Maybe make a morphs list, with notes about what step/location they came from, and which one is active. It DOES look like you can have multiple morphs

Define morphs as functions, morph(morphName) can call them and handle all the prompts and stuff as necessary. This can work.

You know, you could make this even more interesting and use "define command", using all the tools structured so far, and by expanding the idea of $0,$1,$2, etc equals params of calling function to all functions. Basically allow structures that break complex commands into simpler ones. This. In turn, could lead to the generalization of all character attributes to variables, although honestly some structural stuff is good.

Will need to make a package undo mechanism after all -.-
	- maybe not. structured right this could still go decently
	
Some short TODO items also exist in the code

Need to make statusMessages to UIObject for most commands, currently it'll just silently plow through	
	
Currently working on step 7
