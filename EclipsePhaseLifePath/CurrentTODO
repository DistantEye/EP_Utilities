Maybe make a morphs list, with notes about what step/location they came from, and which one is active. It DOES look like you can have multiple morphs
-on hold

Implement an effects list for all the morphs so it simply knows the mechanical effects of each baseline morph 

Some short TODO items also exist in the code

Need to make statusMessages to UIObject for most commands, currently it'll just silently plow through	
	
Make Table 11,69's effect more validated rather than lazy

Remember that characters store a {speedBonus} variable to track any adjustments to speed

Make Sleights also use XML (possibly the whole internalInfo file)

may need to do something special with if conditionals : right now getVar will try and resolve for both branches, which can break things


Two choices in same effect still breaks things. This is an issue for the sklSpec() command
