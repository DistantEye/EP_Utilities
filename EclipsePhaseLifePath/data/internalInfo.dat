<morph>
<type>Biomorph</type>
<name>Aquanaut</name>
<Desc>Aquanauts are environmentally adapted for underwater activities. They have seen a revival on exoplanets with habitable seas and oceans. Their heart rate slows while underwater, their skin includes a layer of blubber that retains heat, they store oxygen in their muscle tissue, and they do not suffer negative health effects from pressure changes. Additionally, their eyes have nictitating membranes and their corneas adjust to counter underwater refraction. Their hands and feet are webbed and they possess a transgenic swim bladder for controlling buoyancy. They can safely descend to about 200 meters depth (roughly 6 atmospheres of pressure) without suffering narcotic effects or other diving problems.</Desc>

<type>Biomorph</type>
<name>Ariel</name>
<Desc>The surprising number of transhumans who chose to sleeve in Titan-adapted hulder morphs encouraged designers on Profunda to develop a Titan-adapted ﬂyer. While the sturdy hulder morph is designed for nomadic herders, the ariel morph is designed by people who wish to survive by hunting. Individuals sleeved in the ariel morph can hunt and eat Titanian caribou, but they most often eat the smaller rabbit-like creatures that Profunda designers have also recently designed to live on Titan. Ariel morphs have exotic-looking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings.
These morphs have also been used by a few daring transhumans to explore the upper cloud layers of both Saturn and Uranus.</Desc>

<Desc>Like the surya and hulder morphs, the cloud skate is another biomorph that pushes the edge of what is possible. It is designed to be able to live in the atmospheres of gas giants, including Jupiter. This morph is shaped roughly like a tailless stingray with a pair of slender arms. The version of the swim bladder used by this morph provides neutral buoyancy in dense atmospheres, preventing it from sinking below a safe depth. Several small outer system collectives are planning to use these morphs to colonize the atmospheres of Saturn and Neptune and are also working on creating versions of animals and plants that can also live in these exotic environments.</Desc>

<morph>
<type>Biomorph</type>
<name>Freeman</name>
<Desc>Many leaders want to ensure loyalty or at least obedience from their citizens, especially recently sleeved infugees. The freeman biomorph offers rulers (some would say tyrants or dictators) a chance to offer citizens a new life without worrying about dissidence. Based on the splicer morph, the freeman is genetically modified to be more obedient, which results in lower Willpower. More insidiously, freeman morphs are genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module implant, these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego’s behavior. (The specific behavior affected is chosen with each optogenetics module implant.)
The freeman comes with a specialized monitor AGI installed in a modified ghostrider module. The monitor, usually a modified fork of the tyrant’s muse, watches and reports all suspicious actions taken by the primary ego. The purpose of this implant is often concealed. Citizens who sleeve into a freeman morph are told the implant is a security measure that helps prevent infection from TITAN technology or some similar lie. The module is designed to resist tampering and will report to headquarters the instant it detects a hacker’s intrusion. The monitor muse can manipulate the ego’s behavior or even take control of the morph via its puppet sock, but avoids doing that unless absolutely necessary. Dictators do not want to reveal that their citizens have spies implanted in their skulls, watching them.
Surprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve into freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.</Desc>

<name>Hulder</name>
<Desc>Hulder are engineered for survival in the Titanian wilds. In silhouette, their bodies resemble a long-legged great auk, though viewed up close, the resemblance to a bird ends. Hulder have no feathers, but rather smooth, rubbery charcoal or black skin covering a thick layer of nano-augmented blubber. What resembles a thick bill from a distance is actually a seamless protrusion of the face, packed with sensory augmentations. Hulder stand 2 meters tall and weigh on average 135 kilograms. Their sensory organs, webbed feet, and fingers are all cybernetic.
Hulder can only tolerate temperatures hospitable to baseline transhumans for short periods of time. In the open, they must balance their bodies’ chemical reservoirs with other hulder and caribou once per month or with a chemical reserve pack. A typical band of 2–6 hulder and 10–20 caribou can go about a year before having to visit a hab or a station like Huvudskär to replenish chemical reserves.</Desc>

<name>Hyperbright</name>
<Desc>This morph is an attempt by a research team on Bright to create a successor to the menton, making it the most intelligence-enhanced morph ever created. Work on the hyperbright morph has been plagued with difficulties, as the designers attempt to push technical limits, creating a morph that can work at peak efficiency without distraction for long periods of time. In an effort to create a morph that proves their design and earns some positive reputation for their project, the creators took short cuts that caused the morph to have several distinctive and potentially annoying quirks, including an inherent need for drugs to stabilize its exotic neurochemistry. The result is a morph that is instantly recognizable by the brightly colored bony crest along the skull that helps cool its brain. Despite its quirks, the hyperbright has gained a small following among a number of scientists and engineers, especially since it has been optimized for use in the low-g environments of the outer system. When created or used on Bright, this morph is usually also fitted with the parallel processor nanoware.</Desc>

<Desc>The uplifted versions of various dolphin species are very similar to baseline dolphins physiologically. Thanks to the oxygen reserve implant, neo-dolphins can stay underwater for longer (Cerean dolphins have gills installed, as the subcrustal sea has no breathable atmosphere above it). Common neo-dolphin germlines lack hands or other limbs, though cybernetic arms or even bioware enhancements are not uncommon.
Neo-dolphin morphs are very rare, since there are few habitats that can support them, and they are almost never found apart from aquatic environments.</Desc>

<Desc>While synthmorphs are the first choice for many gatecrashers, morph designers have made great headway in creating biomorphs suitable for hazardous exoplanets. The nomad biomorph is optimized for operating in desert environments and takes many of its traits from the camel, prompting some observers to mistake the nomad for a pod morph. With an elongated face designed like a camel to trap water vapor in the nostrils as the morph exhales, nomads are clearly off-putting to many bioconservatives. Some models also have camel feet for better travels in sandy dune environments. Nomads are actually quite hefty under normal circumstances, as they are designed to be able to carry large amounts of fat tissue. Their fat tissue can be moved around their body to adapt to high or low temperatures. When nomads are in the field, however, they can become quite skinny, as they survive for months on their fat tissue alone.</Desc>

<name>Salamander</name>
<Desc>Salamanders are a type of biomorph popular with Solarians. They share some of the physiological traits of suryas, but are unable to survive unprotected in the corona (requiring a solar survival suit, like other biomorphs), and are instead bio-engineered to survive in the protected vacuum of coronal habitats. Their skin is thick, hairless, vaguely reptilian, and mostly black in color, with gold and orange body patterning. Like suryas, salamanders communicate either via wireless transmissions or by “sunspotting”—using their chromatophores to shift light and dark patterns on their skin to form patterns easily comprehensible to other coronal morphs. Salamanders have a wiry, streamlined, swept-back sort of look, a combination of fey and monkey-like. Their heads are also somewhat reptilian, with reflective eyes, no nose, and no mouth.
Their feet are prehensile, usable just like hands. They lack reproductive organs and capabilities and feature cyberware gas jets on their chest and back for maneuvering in zero g. Many Solarians who normally inhabit suryas will sleeve into salamanders if they need to use humanoid tools or interact with non-Solarians.</Desc>

<name>Surya</name>
<Desc>Named for a Hindu sun deity, suryas swim freely in the sun’s corona. Looking roughly like whales or orcas, suryas may reach lengths of ten meters or more. They generate powerful magnetic fields that shield them from solar radiation and heat, while allowing them to surf the solar wind and extract ionized particles. Strong bones and connective tissues protect against the crushing solar gravity. Beneath their thick hides are channels of liquid water interleaved with layers of fat which serve to shield the organism from harmful radiation. Engineered medichines repair tissue damaged by radiation and convert hydrogen ions into water.
A surya’s skin is an extraordinary organ, embedded with chromatophores that allow them to transmit alternating patterns of light and dark for communication. In addition, a lateral line runs down their sides, allowing them to detect the long-period sound waves that reflect off the sun’s lower atmosphere and resonate through the corona’s gas and plasma. Suryas traveling through the transition zone between the corona and the chromosphere use these vibrations to predict and avoid heavy solar weather.</Desc>

Ayahs are almost always female with pleasant but not stunningly beautiful features.
Most of the enhanced features of an ayah are built under the hood, so to speak. Their enhanced olfactory capabilities help them monitor the health and emotional state of their wards, as well as alert them to potential environmental dangers. Their ability to withstand temperature extremes and survive without air for short periods helps them protect and rescue their charges in an emergency, such as a hull breach or a fire. Ayahs are often modified with bioweave armor and implanted weapons so they can act as a last line of defense against potential attackers.</Desc>

<em>Tyto pollens</em>was a large pre-Columbian flightless ground owl species in the Caribbean. The chickcharnie was rumored to be a supernatural variant of this bird that haunted the forests bestowing boons or curses upon travelers depending on how they treated it. The Fortean version of the chickcharnie is best described as a humanoid owl. Over one meter in height, it is bipedal but stands shorter than humans. Though winged, it is flightless except in very low grav environments and microgravity. Its wing design, however, incorporates a functional set of clawed hands. The chickcharnie is growing in popularity among neo-avians who don’t mind sacrificing flight for physical resilience, more functional hands, and a stature closely approximating transhuman standards.

<Desc>Critters are pods either genetically hacked together from various animal species or simply biosculpted to appear as such. Originally popular among hyperelites who preferred smarter and distinctive AI-operated pets, they were also sometimes deployed on a covert basis as bodyguards or spies disguised as smart animals. Naturally these morphs were also embraced by people with a furry kink or who simply wanted to test-drive a body that was more bestial. Critter pods come in almost every conceivable type of animal shape, from cats to skunks to chimerical lizard-hyena hybrids. The vast majority are quadruped and stick close to the animal type’s body plan, though anthropomorphic models are also popular and there is a great deal of bodysculpted variety. A model currently popular in the inner system is the bastet, a composite of several wild cat species that resembles a tawny panther or lion, often with intricate patterns based on Egyptian hieroglyphs in their fur. Some users prefer smaller models of this morph with the Reduced Size trait.</Desc>

<Desc>Given the popularity of octomorphs even among nonmercurials, morph designers have sought out a similar morph that is operable in zero g and also designed for speed. Its streamlined form resembles a stylized squid and this morph can move swiftly in both water and air. It can suck either water or air into a cavity in its mantle and then expel it out a siphon in a chosen direction for fast, jet-like propulsion. While popular with neo-octopi, its speed and overall utility has made it an increasingly favorite option with others seeking an aquatic-adapted morph.</Desc>

<name>Hypergibbon</name>
<Desc>Built from siamang genestock, the largest of the lesser apes, hypergibbons are often mistaken for uplifts, although this is not the case. The gibbon was never a candidate for uplift due to a brain anatomy considerably more primitive than great apes. With the addition of a cyberbrain, though, they make excellent pods.
Many primate uplifts choose hypergibbons in place of other pods or when they need something small like a neotenic.
Hypergibbons stand about 1 meter tall, weigh 15 kilograms, and typically have black fur and skin (although bodysculpting permits many variations). They have inflatable throat sacks that allow melodious calls that carry great distances. Their wrists feature a ball-and-socket joint and also naturally dislocate to enable easier swinging by the arms.</Desc>

<Desc>The handiwork of scum genehacker Neville Orsonglass, the jenkin is a byproduct of desperate measures taken during the Fall. The original model was simply the designer’s attempt to keep him and his crewmates alive on a ship with failing life support and recycling systems. From there, it has evolved into the ultimate survivor’s morph, though the definition of “survivor” has now been extended to “can take all of the drugs and still function sexually.” This seems to be a selling point with the scum. Despite the morph’s stooped posture, rat-like features, and pungent personal aroma, the implausibly sized secondary sexual characteristics make it the life of certain kinds of parties.</Desc>

<Desc>Developed by the genehackers of Fortean, ripwings are neogenetic avians, incorporating genetics from a range of flying creatures, some of them prehistoric pterosaur genes acquired from Sky Ark researchers, along with some original genetic traits. These transgenic amalgamations are larger and sturdier than standard neo-avian morphs. They are popular among both neo-avian mercurials who want a more robust form and gatecrashers looking for a quick and stealthy flyer for recon missions. The ripwing morph makes more extensive use of the chiroptera genestocks used to give the first avian uplifts functional hands. Instead of feathers, ripwings feature tough leathery skin or even scales. The morphs are usually a uniform matte black in color, though they are able to change color at will due to their chameleon skin enhancements.</Desc>

They lack the distinctive seam lines applied to most pod morph designs. The skinflex system allows the morph to quickly change its outward appearance. Additional modifications help the morph evade or fool sensor and biometric systems. Shapers are a favorite tool for spies and are excellent for infiltration or fooling surveillance. They are often remotely operated via puppet sock. Shapers are illegal in many habitats.</Desc>

<name>Whiplash</name>
<Desc>Designed by autonomist xenobotanists as an experiment in developing a cyberbrain/planimal interface, whiplash pods are bioengineered from planimal stock found on Sunrise, with other transgenic features. Whiplash pods are gaining some traction among gatecrashers due to their ability to blend in to arboreal environments. The primary modification made to the whiplash stock was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash’s trilobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash’s grasping roots were also converted into even more motile “walking tentacles” borrowed from other Sunrise planimals. Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The barrel-like body remains very similar to the original planimal stock and, reorientation notwithstanding, the digestive system remains mostly unchanged. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash’s feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap.</Desc>

<Desc>This synthmorph was specifically designed to ﬂy between the many moons and habitats in the Saturnian system. It is used by both couriers and smugglers throughout the outer system. This morph appears to be a roughly humanoid head and torso set on a conical base, with a total height of 1.5 meters, that makes it look rather like a four-armed chess piece. This base contains both the morph’s ionic propulsion system, which doubles as a plasma sail in space, and an internal rocket. This miniature metallic hydrogen rocket is specifically designed for low thrust. It provides an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, allowing the morph to take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the solar system.
This engine can operate for a total of one and a half hours before it requires refueling. The morph’s four slender arms fold ﬂat against its torso when it is in ﬂight. Its extensive sensor suit is useful for both navigation and various covert purposes.</Desc>

<name>Fenrir</name>
<Desc>Named for the monstrous wolf of Norse legend, the fenrir is one of the most imposing combat morphs ever developed. It is found only in the armed forces of the Hyoden city-state on Callisto (though black market blueprints/copies are rumored to be available elsewhere). A massive, squat quadrupedal morph designed to be operated by up to six egos simultaneously, the fenrir is more akin to a super-heavy tank than a regular morph. It is possible that a single ego could fill all six ego slots at once through the use of alpha forks, but this has never been tested. The most common weapons mounted are linked HEAP and/or plasmaburst seeker launchers, exoatmospheric plasma beam bolters, and machine railguns loaded with AP rounds.</Desc>
<Note>This morph is unique in that it allows more than one ego to use it at the same time. Ego Sharing may be purchased for this morph an additional four times, for a total of five additional egos.</Note>

<Desc>Based on the kite morph popular with gatecrashers, this morph is somewhat more durable and better armored. It also includes a built-in laser as well as anti-detection measures. Its default mode is turbofan-driven rotorcraft; its light weight allows it to ﬂy and hover, even in thin atmospheres and heavy gravities. In streamlined ionic mode, it can travel at high speeds and maneuver in hurricane-force winds. In vacuum, it can drive itself with thrust-vector nozzles. It is occasionally used for aerial reconnaissance, but is most popular with spies, thieves, and discrete bodyguards.</Desc>

<Desc>Designed for multi-purpose functions, flexbots can transform their shells to suit a range of situations and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multi-legged walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others. Each module features its own sensor units and “bush robot” fractal-branching digits (each capable of breaking into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbot control computer is also distributed between modules. Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics assembly, and so on.

<Desc>Based on the case synthmorph design, griefers are used by vandals, terrorists, and dedicated trolls to harass enemies and antagonize the masses. Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems so they can easily harass an individual or an entire crowd. They are also typically equipped with numerous hacking tools and software aids, though they do not come with these by default. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance in some systems. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that killing a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.</Desc>

<Desc>Nautiloids are a hybrid of short-range spacecraft and submersible capable of holding up to six passengers and their gear. The morph is shaped like a van-sized nautilus, with crew space in the head and shell. A cluster of tentacular limbs mounted under the observation ports in the head provide both fine and brute force manipulation. Originally created for comet and asteroid mining, the design also proved useful for oceanic exploration by gatecrashing teams and Europans.
The morph’s interior includes a desktop cornucopia machine and a maker. It can deploy a pair of retractable pontoons for stability when ﬂoating on a liquid surface. A nautiloid’s life support system can support its occupants for up to three months before replenishing—indefinitely if it has a source of hydrogen and oxygen. Nautiloids include radiation shielding, a small airlock, and a healing vat.
The nautiloid is also available as a bot with no cyberbrain for the same cost. The bot version has no aptitude bonuses.</Desc>

<Desc>The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleoperation or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity, and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even to change shape and length. In gravity environments, the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs. Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows, if not get you arrested.</Desc>

<type>Synth</type>
<name>Spare</name>
<Desc>Spare morphs are small, cheap, lightweight, synthetic shells designed to be used as a replacement should someone’s original morph be killed or destroyed. A cortical stack (retrieved from the character’s previous morph) can be easily plugged into the spare morph, effectively resleeving them (they must make Integration, Alienation, and Continuity Tests as normal). Once plugged in, it takes only 3 Action Turns for the cortical stack’s data to be read and checked for integrity and the ego to run inside the spare’s cyberbrain.
Spares are designed for portability. Packed as a flat disc 15 centimeters in diameter and with a mass of 2 kilograms, when activated they pop into a spherical shape with 6 slender and retractable 20-centimeter limbs (3 arms and 3 legs). They are a common piece of equipment for gatecrashing teams.</Desc>

<name>Sphere</name>
<Desc>Popular with AGIs and synthmorph activists, this morph is a sphere approximately one meter in diameter. It can extend up to four ﬂexible limbs as required, and typically hovers at approximately human eye level. The first tests of this morph revealed that the chameleon surface was necessary because it allows the user to display the image of a face, which made most transhumans both more comfortable talking with this morph and less likely to assume that it is a robot.</Desc>

<Desc>Designed as a top-end version of the steel morph, this shell's entire outer covering is composed of active nanomachines. A number of synthmorph performers use this shell's shape- and color-altering capacities as part of their acts. However, the fact that this morph can disguise itself as any other humanoid synthmorph, including the ubiquitous case morph, means that a number of covert operatives and criminals also make use of this morph. This version of the steel morph cannot use a synthetic mask.</Desc>

They look a little like ramjets, except for a pair of articulated arms that extend forward from the morph’s pointed nose, allowing it to reach for and grasp objects. Because sundivers operate in the coronal environment, they are built to survive superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. Sundivers are equipped with a powerful electromagnetic propulsion system that allows them to skate along solar magnetic lines of force much like the surya do.</Desc>

<desc>An async with this sleight can attempt to gain an intuitive understanding of non-sentient, non-terrestrial organisms occupying a producer niche in the local ecosystem (e.g., alien plant and fungus analogues). If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they gain a basic understanding of the organism’s place in the local ecosystem, as well as whether it’s safe and nutritious for transhuman consumption. The information gained is of a general and qualitative nature and doesn’t include any data that would normally be gained by chemical or genetic analysis. For example, an eco-empathic async could tell that a given plant thrives only in riparian zones, relies on local insect analogs for pollination, and has tubers that become edible if well cooked. They would not be able to tell that the same plant has over a thousand chromosomes, that it exudes a chemical that is physically addicting to the insects, or that the tubers contain high concentrations of a toxic lectin that breaks down and becomes harmless if boiled.</desc>

Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or code-breaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code).

This can be useful for “archiving” important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a “data dump” for the target to peruse.

<desc>This sleight hijacks the target’s sensorium, replacing it with a virtual scenario controlled by the exsurgent. The effect is much like being jacked into a simulspace scenario, albeit against the target’s will. While the exsurgent cannot harm the target in the scenario, they can learn something about the person’s behavioral responses to certain situations. While under the influence of this sleight, the target is cut off from their physical senses (–60 to any Perception Tests), but they may flail about and otherwise respond physically to events in the scenario, which may cause them to hurt themselves and will make them seem crazy to onlookers. Targets may attempt to ignore the scenario and concentrate on the real world, but this requires a WIL Test each Action Turn and they suffer a –30 modifier from disorientation even if they succeed.</desc>

<desc>Strip allows the exsurgent to suppress certain memories in the target’s mind. This can be used to block memories of certain events or even the victim’s identity. The process is not exact, however, and so the memories may not be fully suppressed and/or related memories may also be blocked; the gamemaster decides on the effect as determined by the MoS. Strip can also be used to temporarily erase a specific skill from the target’s mind, preventing them from using or even defaulting to that ability while so affected.</desc>

<trait>
<name>Adaptability</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</cost>
<description>Resleeving is a breeze for this
character. They adjust to new morphs much more quickly than most
other people. Apply a +10 modifier per level for Integration
Tests and Alienation Tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>AGI Affinity</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>The character has spent a significant amount of time around
AGIs, to the point where socializing with an AGI is far easier. The
character gains a +10 modifier on Social Skill Tests against AGIs as
well as characters with the Real World Naivete trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>AGI Socialization</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>Only AGI characters may take this trait and only during
character generation. The character is more adept at interpreting
social cues than the average infolife. The character gains a +10
bonus on all Kinesics Tests made against transhumans. This bonus does
not apply to other AGIs, uplifts, aliens, or exsurgents.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Alien Biochemistry</name>
<description>It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds
with different biochemistries are now being transformed into pods by
transhuman geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these
creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this
means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic
implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments
beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while
something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be
toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster
decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod
biochemistry's similarity to that of transhumans and numerous
other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available,
having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in
question.
While efforts have been made to provide these pods with
their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protections offered by
those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the
pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging,
lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from
injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity
has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to
heal quickly or regenerate limbs. It is also possible that the pod
may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its
species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up
hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia.
Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive.
Morphs with alien
biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to
Alienation and Integrity Tests. This trait is only available to pods
created from alien life.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Allies</name>
<cost>Cost: 30 CP</cost>
<description>The character is part of or has a relationship with some
influential group that they can occasionally call on for support. For
example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research
lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite
social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the
character's relationship is with this group, and why the
character can call on them for aid. Gamemaster's should take
care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more
than once per game session. The character's ties to this group
are also a two-way street+they will be expected to perform
duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for
scenarios).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Ambidextrous</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character can use and manipulate objects equally well
with both hands (they do not suffer the off-hand modifier). If the
character has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc),
this trait may be applied to a limb other than the hand. This trait
may be taken multiple times for multiple limbs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Animal Empathy</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>The character has an instinctive feel for handling and
working with non-sapient animals of all kinds. Apply a +10 modifier
to Animal
Handling
skill tests or whenever the character makes a test to influence or
interact with an animal.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Async Familiarity</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>This character has a keen sense for the subtle behavioral
clues and micro-expressions that many asyncs unconsciously adopt
after their infection. As a result, they may make a Kinesics
Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone.
Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (-30) at
best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod
infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among
asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs
or spent significant time in their presence.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Brave</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This character does not scare easily, and will face threats,
intimidation, and certain bodily harm without flinching. As a side
effect, the character is not always the best at gauging risks,
especially when it comes to factoring in danger to others. The
character receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear or
intimidation.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Civilian Analyst</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>The character is a civilian
analyst in a large intelligence agency such as the Titanian Ministry
of State's Civilian Intelligence Directorate or the Planetary
Consortium's Oversight. At Level 2, the character is a manager
coordinating the work of 3-5 other analysts and a few dozen
AIs, or a senior non-manager. For each level, the character receives
a +10 on all Networking Tests within their agency. The character is
actively employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of
work four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week
(if Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian). In some polities, the
character may be able to work remotely. This trait may be a poor
choice for Jovian characters, as most Jovian intel analysts are
confined to the Castle, with very limited freedom of movement. Also
note that characters making frequent requests for secret information
not related to their job functions will draw scrutiny.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Common Sense</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character has an innate sense of judgment that cuts
through other distractions and factors that might cloud a decision.
Once per game session, the player may ask the gamemaster what choice
they should make or what course of action they should take, and the
gamemaster should give them solid advice based on what the character
knows. Alternately, if the character is about to make a disastrous
decision, the gamemaster can use the character's free hint and
warn the player they are making a mistake.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Coronal Adaptation (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 30 CP</cost>
<description>For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject's
metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair
radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful
electromagnetic fields that protect the character from the intense
temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable
the character to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation
cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar
environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical
support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also
have medichines.
For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the
morph's composition with heat-resistant materials capable of
surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The
shell is also equipped with refractive metamaterials and a perfectly
mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective
surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy
that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive
radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of
energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also
protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic
lines.
This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph's
Free
Fall
skill tests in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. It also
provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and
electromagnetic-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma
weapons, but not explosions).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Danger Sense</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character has an intuitive sixth sense that warns them
of imminent threats. They receive a +10 modifier on Surprise Tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Direction Sense</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>Somehow the character always knows which way is up, north,
etc., even when blinded. The character receives a +10 modifier for
figuring out complex directions, reading maps, and remembering or
retracing a path they have taken.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Digital Ghost</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character has an intuitive knack for keeping their
computer intrusions out of the spotlight. Once per game session, the
hacker may prevent a Severe Failure or Critical Failure from
downgrading their status on a hacked system (see Failing
Tests).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Dominant Strain</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>(Asyncs only)
This trait is only available to asyncs. The Watts-MacLeod
virus has a special hold on the async and aggressively resists
attempts by other strains of the exsurgent virus to gain a foothold
in the character.
Instead of the usual -20 penalty to resist
infection, the character gains a +10 bonus. Any time they must make
such a test, however, they immediately suffer the effects of a
derangement for 1d10 hours after the test is resolved as the
Watts-MacLeod strain asserts itself. They incur no stress along with
this derangement, but multiple tests to resist infection may, at the
gamemaster's discretion, incur additional derangements.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Drug Exception (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character or morph has an unusual resistance to
addiction for one particular biological or chemical drug (but not
nanodrugs or narcoalgorithms). Addiction Tests for using that drug or
resisting an addiction craving are made with a +20 modifier.
Furthermore, the character halves the penalty for minor and moderate
addiction to that drug, but still suffers full penalties from major
addiction.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Ego Plasticity</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), or 30 CP (Level 3)</cost>
<description>Merging forks
can be stressful under the best of circumstances, but some people
handle the process better than others. Per level, the character gains
a +10 modifier on all Merging Tests and suffers -1 SV when
merging forks.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Eidetic Memory (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>Much like a computer, the character has perfect memory
recall. They can remember anything they have sensed, often even from
a single glance. This works the same as the eidetic memory implant.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Enlarged Size (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This trait increases the size of an existing morph model
from either small to medium or medium to large (morphs may only be
enlarged once). Morphs enlarged to a medium size lose the effects of
the Small Size trait and gain 5 points of Durability. Morphs enlarged
to a large size gain the effects of the Large Size trait and 10
points of Durability. Durability increases also effect Wound
Threshold and Death Rating as normal. Enlarging a morph may affect
other changes at the gamemaster's discretion. For example,
morphs that relied on their small size for fight may lose that
capability or suffer modifiers.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Entrepreneur</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), or 30 CP (Level 3)</cost>
<description>This
character is the owner or co-owner of their own small hypercorp,
microcorp, or business franchise+or an active participant in an
autonomist cooperative, collective, or work syndicate. This entity
has its own reputation score in an appropriate social network; at the
beginning of game play, this rep score equals the trait level x 20.
As an owner/member, the character can call upon this rep score for
favors, information, and goods, just as they would their own rep
score.
At the gamemster's discretion, this venture can
provide other benefits, such as enabling opportunities for smuggling,
making offcial inquiries, or providing a cover for clandestine
activities. Though a character can handle much of their
management/participation in their businesses or cooperative work
project via the mesh and forking, the gamemaster should ensure that
the relationship is not strictly a one-way street and occasionally
place obligations on the character to take care of business affairs.
The gamemaster and player should work together to define the nature
of the business/cooperative, such as what it focuses on, where it is
based, and the other important participants. These ventures are more
than just another resource for the character to call upon, as they
can also be used to sew new plot seeds or create new role-playing
opportunities.
The reputation score of this venture should
fuctuate during game play, much like a player character's.
This may be in part due to the character's actions, but could
also result from economic or political factors outside the
character's control.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Established Fork</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>The character begins the game with a fully instanced fork of
themselves, and the player can specify if it is an alpha, beta, or
delta fork; beta and delta forks will have their stats adjusted
according to the rules outlined in Forking
and Merging.
Psychosurgical alterations that differentiate the fork from the
character such as personality edits, mannerisms, and gender/sexual
identity (but not traits) can be defined by the player and
incorporated into the fork at no cost. Any other positive or negative
mental traits taken for the fork must be purchased and applied to the
fork exclusively. The fork's morph and gear must be paid for
and provided by expenditure of the character's own CP and
starting credits. This trait ensures the fork is established and
recognized as legal in whatever habitat the character lives in when
the game starts, but there is no guarantee that the fork would be
recognized as legal elsewhere or that the legality will remain
current once the game is underway. This trait can be taken more than
once. Players should carefully coordinate with their gamemaster to
ensure a common understanding of the fork's place in the game
and how they can be utilized.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Exceptional Aptitude (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 20 CP</cost>
<description>As an ego trait, the character may raise the maximum for a
particular chosen aptitude to 40 rather than 30. As a morph trait, it
raises the morph aptitude maximum for a particular chosen aptitude by
10 (30 for flats, 35 for splicers, 40 for all others). Note that this
trait just raises the maximum, it does not give the character 10 more
aptitude points.
This trait may only be taken by a morph or ego
once.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Expert</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character is a legend in the use of one particular
skill. The character may raise one learned skill over 80, to a
maximum of 90, during character creation. This trait does not
actually increase the skill, it just raises the maximum. This trait
may only be taken once.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Fast Learner</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character improves skills and learns new ones in half
the time it normally takes.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>First Impression</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character has a way of charming or otherwise making a
good impression the first time they interact with someone. This
innate social lubricant allows them to more readily deal with new
contacts and slip right into new social environments. Apply a +10
modifier on social skill tests when the character is interacting with
another character for the first time only.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Gold Star</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>At some point in their past, this character did something
that permanently earned them a place in the historical annals of a
particular faction. Choose one faction. Each time the character
interacts with that faction (such as with Networking
Tests) or with an NPC from this faction who knows the character, they
gain a +10 modifier. This trait is incompatible with the Black Mark
trait for the same faction.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Hardening</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>Either through repeated exposure or simply due to a willful
aspect of the character's personality, the character is
desensitized to one particular type of stressful experience. The
player may choose one entry from the Stressful
Experiences
table, the Continuity
Stress
table, or any other specific experience that causes stress, such as
specific psychosurgery procedures or Alienation Tests with a
particular type of morph, with gamemaster approval. They are immune
to stress from this source. This trait may be taken more than once,
for hardening to different experiences. Each time it is taken, the
character's maximum Moxie score is reduced by 1. Characters may
not become hardened to the merging of forks. Characters that become
hardened through repeat exposure gain this trait for free.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Heightened Instinct</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to uplifts. Though the
character is fully sapient and normally socialized, the uplift
process left much of their unconscious instinct intact, and they are
able to synthesize a great deal of contextual information
instinctively. This provides a marked advantage when dealing with
confusing or tense situations, as the character's subconscious
drives their actions and responses faster than conscious
decision-making. The character receives a +1 bonus to Initiative and
ignores up to -10 of any modifiers for distraction when making
skill tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>High Temperature Operation (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This morph has been designed to operate only in
high-temperature environments, enabling them to withstand
temperatures up to 1,000 C. This morph loses 1 point of COO for every
5 minutes it spends at temperatures lower than 250 C, and 1 point of
COO for every minute that it spends below 150 C. When its COO equals
zero the morph becomes completely immobile. This same penalty is
applied to all COO-based skill rolls. The morph's cyberbrain
and mesh access still work in these circumstances, but the morph
cannot physically move under its own power. Even if placed back in
higher temperatures, if it was previously reduced to total
immobility, the morph halves its COO and SOM (round down) until it
has been serviced.
This trait may only be applied to synthmorphs.
It provides 5 points of Energy armor against heat-based attacks (such
as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Home Turf</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This character knows a particular habitat like the back of
their hand, paw, or tentacle, having grown up there or spent years
familiarizing themselves. They receive an extra point of Moxie that
may only be used for tests that apply to that habitat, such as
navigating the best route, bypassing airlock controls, or hacking its
infrastructure.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Hyper Linguist</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character has an intuitive understanding of linguistic
structures that facilitates learning new languages easily. The
character requires one-third the normal amount of time and experience
to learn any language. The character can also learn any human
language in one day simply by constant immersive exposure to it.
Additionally, the character receives a +10 modifier when attempting
to interpret languages they don't know.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Improved Immune System (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</cost>
<description>The morph's immune system is
robust and more resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins+even
more than basic bio-mods. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier whenever
making a test to resist infection or the effects of a toxin or drug.
At Level 2, increase this modifier to +20. This trait is only
available to biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Indenture Holder</name>
<cost>Cost: 30 CP</cost>
<description>The character currently owns the indenture contract of
another ego. The person subject to indenture could be anyone from a
Fall infugee to a criminal working off the damages of an assault
charge. The indenture itself could have been voluntarily arranged
with the character, awarded by a court, or the character could have
bought it through IndEX. The terms and conditions that will end the
indenture should be clearly determined as a set credit amount, levels
of favors expended, or provision of specific services. It is
recommended that the contractual services are reasonably likely to be
completed within 6 months.
Players and gamemasters should
collaborate to establish the relationship the character has with the
indenture and the exact skills and reputations of the NPC.
Gamemasters should be very careful that this trait is not abused, and
remember that, as the indenture holder, the character also has some
responsibilities to the NPC. Physical harm, mental trauma, and
illegal activities could negate the terms of indenture and may have
serious repercussions for the character. Should the character treat
their indenture well, they could become a trusted ally, but ill
treatment could make them into an enemy.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Information Control</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This character has a knack for diligence and caution in
their daily living, online, and social networking interactions,
reducing the amount of extraneous or sensitive information about
themselves that leaks out in the public eye. Apply a -10
modifier to any Research Tests to gather information on the character
or track them online (see Scanning, Tracking, and Monitoring) and any
Networking Tests to ascertain the character's networking
interactions (see Keeping It Quiet).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Innocuous (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>In an age when exotic appearances and good looks are
commonplace, the morph's look is surprisingly bland and
undistinguished, in that cookie cutter sort of way. The character's
physical looks are so mundane that others have a hard time picking
them out of a crowd, describing their appearance, or otherwise
remembering physical details. Apply a -10 modifier to all tests
made to spot, describe, or remember the character. This modifier does
not apply to psi or mesh searches.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Intuitive Cracker</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>When it comes to brute-force
hacking, this character has an intuitive sense for finding and
deploying the right exploit tool for the job. Reduce the base
timeframe for brute-force hacking by 20% per level. Since
brute-forcing a system is normally a Task Action with a 20 Action
Turn timeframe, at Level 1 this timeframe is reduced to 16 Action
Turns and at Level 2 it is reduced to 12 Action Turns. As usual,
every 10 points of MoS on the Infosec Test may reduce this another
10%; these and other reductions (such as from Speed and extra
actions) are added together before they are applied to the timeframe.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Killer Instinct (Uplifts Only)</name>
<cost>Cost: 15 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to uplifts, and is most common
in those from octopus or orca genestock. During uplift the most
predatory aspect of the character's psyche was left largely
intact, and this has left them comfortable with bloodletting. The
character does not take stress from committing extreme violence in
situations they feel are justified and necessary, and they receive a
+30 modifier on Stress Tests when witnessing extreme violence
committed by others.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Limber (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</cost>
<description>The morph is especially flexible
and supple, capable of graceful contortions and interesting
positions. At Level 1, the character can smoke with their toes, do
the splits, and squeeze into small, cramped spaces. At Level 2, they
are double-jointed escape artists. Each level provides a +10 modifier
to escaping from bonds, fitting into narrow confines, and other acts
relying on contortion or flexibility. This trait is only available to
biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Machine Intuition (AGIs only)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to AGIs. The AGI is so attuned
to dealing with machines that it has an intuitive knack for
discovering the actual source of electronic or programming problems.
Apply a +10 modifier to Interfacing,
Hardware,
or Programming
Tests that involve diagnosing a technical problem or repairing it.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Malleable Mind</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)</cost>
<description>Either through a
natural quirk or psychosurgical conditioning, the character's
neural architecture is especially malleable and more readily accepts
psychosurgical changes. Apply a -10 modifier per level to the
character's WIL x 3 Test when receiving voluntary psychosurgery
(including neural pruning of forks). This modifier does not apply to
involuntary psychosurgery.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Math Wiz</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character can perform any feat of calculation, including
the most complex and advanced mathematics, instantly and with great
precision, with the same ease an unmodified human can add 2 + 3. The
character can calculate odds with great precision, find correlations
in numerical data, and perform similar tasks with great ease. Apply a
+30 modifier on tests involving math calculations.

<trait>
<name>Military Intelligence</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This trait may only be taken by characters with the Military
Rank trait (below). Since all members of JSFI are commissioned
officers, Jovian characters must have Military Rank of at least Level
2.
The character is posted to their military's intelligence
service. This makes it possible for the character to use reputation
to garner classified information at one Favor level lower than
normal, but it also immerses the character in the spook world,
limiting their movements and greatly complicating their collaboration
with Firewall. Players taking this trait should consult with the
gamemaster as to how their character is able to operate as part of
Firewall at all with other spies looking over their shoulder.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Military Rank</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)</cost>
<description>Jovian:

The character is an officer in the Jovian Space Force or Jovian Space
Force Marines. Level 1 makes the character an NCO: a warrant officer,
sergeant, or senior airman. Level 2 makes the character a low-ranking
commissioned officer: a first or second lieutenant. Level 3 makes the
character a mid-ranked commissioned officer: a captain or
major.

Titanian:

The character is an officer in the Commonwealth Fleet, Marines, or
Coast Guard. Level 1 makes the character an NCO: a warrant officer,
sergeant, or petty officer. Level 2 makes the character a low-ranking
commissioned officer: a pilot officer, lieutenant, or officer. Level
3 makes the character a mid-ranked commissioned officer: a squadron
leader, major, or commanding officer.
For each level, the
character receives a +10 on all Networking Tests within their service
branch. The character is on active duty, with all of the attendant
structure and responsibilities of military life. Usually this
includes being stationed in a specific place or on a specific vessel.
However, the character might also have a desk job or be support
staff. Players taking this trait must seek gamemaster permission and
develop a plausible story for how their character is able to
participate in Firewall missions while on active duty. Also note that
this trait affects only the character's Networking Tests.
Favors involving acquiring hardware, deploying military units, or the
like still require plausible explanations as to how the character is
manipulating the military command and logistics systems, and will
have serious consequences if the character's superiors judge
them to be abusing their position. Rank-and-file grunts don't
need to take this trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Minion/Partner</name>
<cost>Cost: 30 CP</cost>
<description>The character has a personal employee, assistant, intern, or
other form of retainer on hand to help them out. This could range
from a hired bodyguard to a personal secretary to a solo socialite
entourage. The relationship also does not need to be hierarchical;
the character could have a partner or other collaborator. This
minion/partner should be developed in conjunction between the player
and gamemaster and fully drawn up using the character creation rules,
with their role and motivations spelled out. While most minions are
in it for the money, and most partners share an interest or goal with
the character, this NPC might also be motivated by loyalty,
friendship, personal career interest, fandom, or to repay a debt or
obligation.
For the most part, the player should be allowed to run
this NPC as a secondary character. The minion/partner is an NPC,
however, and the gamemaster may take control of the NPC at any time.
The relationship must be maintained, else the minion/partner will
part ways with the character. The character should occasionally have
to address the minion's or partner's own needs, which can
be exploited for roleplaying and plot purposes.
</description>

<trait>
<name>Morph Fever Resistance (Asyncs Only)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to asyncs. The async does not
suffer stress effects from extended periods sleeved in a pod, synth,
or infomorph.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Murder Simulator Addict</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>Thousands of hours spent in various simulspace combat games
have sharpened the character's aim and reflexes+or
they've simply spent an inordinate amount of time at the range
practicing headshots. When making called shots in ranged combat to
target an opponent's head, this character does not suffer the
usual -10 called shot modifier. They still suffer the -10
modifier for other called shots, however.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Natural Immunity (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The morph has a natural immunity to a specific drug,
disease, or toxin. When afflicted with that specific chemical,
poison, or pathogen, the character remains unaffected. At the
gamemaster's discretion, this immunity may not apply to certain
agents. It may not be applied to nanodrugs or nanotoxins. This trait
is only available to biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Pain Tolerance (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</cost>
<description>The character has a high threshold
for pain tolerance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on
their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them to ignore the
-10 modifier from 1 wound. Level 2 allows them to ignore the
-10 modifiers from 2 wounds. This trait is only available for
biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Patron</name>
<cost>Cost: 30 CP</cost>
<description>The character has an influential person in their life who
can be relied on for occasional support. This could be a wealthy
hyperelite family member, a high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist
networker with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon, this
patron can pull strings on the character's behalf, supply
resources, introduce them to people they need to know, and bail them
out of trouble. The player and gamemaster should work together to
define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the
player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is
supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation?
childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters
should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron
should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game
session at most) but is not always at the character's
beck-and-call. If the character asks for too much, too often, they
should find the patron's support drying up. Additionally, the
character may need to take action to maintain the relationship, such
as undertaking a mission on the patron's behalf. In fact, the
character may only have their patronage because they are on-call or
of use to the NPC in some way.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Personal Connection</name>
<cost>Cost: 15 CP</cost>
<description>The character has some sort of personal connection that
often allows them to get one particular category of goods or services
at a discount in most major habitats. Perhaps an old friend owns a
body bank corp, their family is in the shipping business, they won a
lifetime membership discount for a common retail chain, or someone in
a criminal cartel owes them a life-long obligation. The player
chooses one particular type of goods or services, such as morphs,
cargo shipping, weapons, robots, software, implants, and so on. The
character can usually acquire these goods or services at one cost
category cheaper. This does not apply to Expensive goods. The player
may use this trait as often as they wish, but the gamemaster may rule
that is simply not available in certain settlements+their
connection may not have a presence there or may be too strained for
resources to offer the discount. Also at the gamemaster's
discretion, if the character takes actions that would substantially
compromise the relationship that enables this discount, they may be
temporarily unable to use this trait or may even lose it for good.
This trait does not reduce the cost of goods and services acquired
during character creation, nor may it be taken in conjunction with
the Tenure trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Phoenix</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>Transhumans who die and
resleeve frequently are nicknamed "phoenixes." Death
holds little sway over these daring characters, so the trauma of lost
continuity has lost much of its sting. The character gains a +20
bonus on Continuity Tests at Level 1, and a +30 bonus at Level 2.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Police Officer</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>The character is a mid-ranking
cop+a sergeant or detective+in the Martian Rangers,
Titanian Science Police, or other police department. At Level 2, the
character is a high-ranking officer: chief inspector, chief of single
station or district, or high-ranking desk officer in a large
department. For each level, the character receives a +10 on all
Networking Tests within their department. The character is actively
employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of work
four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week (if
Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian). Rank-and-file officers don't
need to take this trait. Characters using favors to deploy other
officers or use department resources may have to explain their
actions to superiors.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Potent Mind (Asyncs Only)</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to characters that also have the
Psi trait and the Psychic Stab sleight. The character's mind is
especially invasive and damaging when used against others. Inflict an
extra 1d10 DV when using the Psychic Stab sleight.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Predator (Uplifts Only)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to uplifts, and is most common
in those from octopus or orca genestock. The uplift retains the
thrill of the hunt from its predatory ancestry. The character
receives a +10 modifier on Infiltration
Tests when stalking a target and a +10 bonus on the first attack
against a surprised opponent.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Professional Courtesy</name>
<cost>Cost: 5 CP</cost>
<description>Although higher-ups in your organization probably aren't
thrilled about it, you've run into the operatives and field
agents of another faction or conspiracy often enough that you've
earned some leeway with them. Choose a group engaged in covert ops,
intelligence work, or paramilitary actions: when encountering agents
of that group in the context of a mission, you gain a +10 bonus on
all social tests against them, as they treat you with grudging
respect+or at least more tolerance than they otherwise would
for a member of your organization. Discuss with your gamemaster to
detail what your character did to gain the respect of this other
group.
This trait does not guarantee safety or cooperation between
you and members of the chosen organization, only some additional
consideration between professionals. Depending on the particulars of
an encounter, it may provide some shared information, a moment of
detente to face a common foe, or the chance to determine how
to stay out of each others' way.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Psi</name>
<cost>Cost: 20 CP (Level 1), 25 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>The character has been infected
with the Watts-MacLeod strain of the Exsurgent virus, which altered
their brain structure and opened the potential for their mind to
enhance their cognitive abilities and read and manipulate the
biological minds of others (see Playing
Asyncs).
The character may purchase and learn psi sleights. At Level 1, the
character may only use psi-chi sleights. At Level 2, the character
may use both psi-chi and psi-gamma sleights. Though this trait is not
very expensive, gamemasters should not allow it to be abused. There
are a number of negative side effects to Watts-MacLeod infection,
noted under Psi
Drawbacks.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Psi Chameleon (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character's mental state is naturally resistant to
psi sensing. Apply a -10 modifier to any attempts to locate or
detect the character via psi sleights.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Psi Defense (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</cost>
<description>The character's mind is
inherently resistant to mental attacks. At Level 1, apply a +10
modifier to all defense tests made against psi attacks. At Level 2,
apply a +20 modifier.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Rapid Healer (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The morph recovers from damage more quickly. Reduce the
timeframes for healing by half, as noted on the Healing
table. This trait is only available to biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Right at Home</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character chooses one type of morph (splicer,
neo-hominid, case, etc.). The character always feels right at home in
morphs of this type. When resleeving into this type of morph, the
character automatically adjusts to the new body, no Integration or
Alienation Test needed, suffering no penalties and no mental stress.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Second Skin</name>
<cost>Cost: 15 CP</cost>
<description>If your character background or faction enforces a
restriction on your starting morph (for example, uplifts must start
with an uplift morph), this trait allows you to ignore that
restriction and purchase a starting morph of your choice.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Situational Awareness</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character is very good at maintaining continuous partial
awareness of the goings-on in their immediate environment. In game
terms, they do not suffer the Distracted modifier on Perception
Tests to notice things even when their attention is focused
elsewhere, or when making Quick Perception Tests during combat.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Skill Artifact (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>The morph has latent skills
stored in muscle memory or as higher-level data that refuses to be
erased. This is especially common for exotic or alien morphs. At
level 1, the morph has a single Active skill at a rating of 30 (plus
aptitude) or a single Knowledge skill at 40 (plus aptitude). Level 2
adds a second skill. This new skill suppresses the ego's
pre-existing rating in that skill, similar to a skillware system.
These skills cannot be changed or turned off as long as the ego is
sleeved in that morph. This does not reduce the number of skills that
can be used as part of a skillware system. This trait may not be
bought more than once.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Social Animal (Hominid/Cetacean Uplifts Only)</name>
<cost>Cost: 15 CP</cost>
<description>This trait is only available to hominid and cetacean
uplifts. The species of origin for these uplifts naturally forms
tightly bonded social groups, and that characteristic has been
enhanced along with their intelligence. Whenever characters with this
background are around family or close associates, they feel a strong
sense of security and purpose that grants a +10 bonus on all Stress
Tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Social Butterfly</name>
<cost>Cost: 15 CP</cost>
<description>This character is a promiscuous abuser of online social
networks. Because they go out of their way to make new connections
and interact with people, they find it slightly easier to get what
they need. Apply a +10 modifier to Networking Tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Spacecraft</name>
<cost>Cost: 30 CP</cost>
<description>Buying a personal spacecraft is far beyond the means of most
characters. This trait, however, puts a spacecraft in the character's
hands, with certain conditions. This trait may only be taken with
gamemaster approval and it is best only considered for campaigns
where regular space travel is likely to be a major element. Somehow,
the character is responsible for a bulk carrier, GEV, LLOTV, scum
barge, SLOTV, or standard transport. How and why this occurred+and
what strings are attached+should be worked out between the
player and gamemaster. The character could be an employed pilot or
captain, placed in charge of a hypercorp-owned vessel. Perhaps they
are borrowing a ship belonging to a criminal cartel, hyperelite
dynasty, or anarchist collective. Maybe they built the ship on their
own, but placed themselves permanently in the debt of an esoteric
brinker group or smuggling crew to get the materials they needed. The
ship may even be stolen, with a bounty out for its recapture.
Whatever the circumstances, the character should occasionally be
obligated to meet or avoid the needs and demands of the ships'
rightful owners, its passengers, and its crew. For example, the
character may have salvaged a derelict vessel and converted it into a
refugee barge during the Fall, but must now deal with the scum
squatters that have effectively taken it over. Operating a ship also
comes with a host of logistical issues, from acquiring reaction mass
to making deals for passengers and cargo to somehow funding an
inexhaustible list of critical repairs. Keeping the ship operational
could become a campaign unto itself.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Special Agent</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>The character is a field agent of
the Titanian Security Police, the secret police of one of the Martian
city-states, the Jovian CDC, or a similar organization. At Level 2,
the character is a supervising agent coordinating the work of 5-10
other agents. For each level, the character receives a +10 on all
Networking Tests within their agency. The character is actively
employed there and is expected to put in at least 6 hours of work
four days a week (if Titanian) or 8 hours a day five days a week (if
Jovian, Venusian, Lunar, or Martian). Players taking this trait must
seek gamemaster permission and develop a plausible story for how
their character is able to participate in Firewall missions while
working for the agency. Their work requires them to be physically
present, although whether they're stationed in a specific place
or are deployed more widely depends on their agency role. Characters
using favors to deploy other agents or access secret information not
related to their jobs will eventually have to explain their actions
to superiors.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Striking Looks (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</cost>
<description>In an age where biosculpting is
easy, good looks are both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however,
possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and
unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating+even the
gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests
where the character's beauty may affect the outcome, they
receive a +10 (for Level 1) or +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This
modifier is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the infolife
or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only available to
biomorphs.
This modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but
at half the cost, and it is only effective against characters with
that specific uplift background (i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids,
etc.).
The one drawback to this trait is that the character is
more easily noticed and remembered.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Tacnet Sniper</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>If they have eyes on the target through an ally's
tacnet link, the character can make indirect fire attacks with only a
-10 modifier rather than the usual -30. This only applies
if the character uses tacnet, not through any other means.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Tenure</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>The character holds a tenured professorship at a university
such as Titan Autonomous University or the University of Mars. This
position gives them privileged access to the university's
resources, funds, and grad assistants. The character receives a +20
bonus on Networking
Tests involving the university and its staff. Additionally, favors
such as goods, services, and information acquired via those
university network connections are one favor level lower. These
bonuses do not extend outside the university's influence. The
tenured character will, of course, be expected to occasionally
produce research results or other findings or pieces of work to
validate their exploitation of university resources.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Tough (Morph Trait)</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP</cost>
<description>This morph is
resilient than others of its type and can take more physical abuse.
Increase their Durability by +5 per level (+5 at Level 1, +10 at
Level 2, and +15 at Level 3). This also increases Wound Threshold by
+1, +2, and +3 respectively.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Trauma Tolerance</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</cost>
<description>This character has a higher
threshold for handling traumatic experiences and is better at
ignoring the effects of stress on their abilities and concentration.
Level 1 allows them to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 trauma.
Level 2 allows them to ignore the -10 modifiers from 2 traumas.
Initiative modifiers still apply. In both cases, the character is
also not immediately inflicted with any derangements as a result of
these traumas. Any additional traumas affect the character as normal;
postponed derangements don't count for the purpose of raising
derangement effects, but they do count towards determining when a
disorder is applied. Blocking out traumatically stressful experiences
is a temporary measure, however, as the experience still lingers and
festers in the dark recesses of the character's mind. A short
period of time later (1d10 / 2 hours, round down), the
character's facade of mental fortitude will crack and the -10
trauma modifier(s) and derangement(s) will kick in at one level
higher. A character who ignored a trauma that would have inflicted a
minor derangement, for example, will a few hours later be struck by a
moderate derangement.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Unique Contact</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>You have a personal tie to an individual with unique skills
or resources of particular value to your clandestine activities. This
connection may be be based on blood or family ties, shared history,
or some other situation that permanently linked you together. Though
the contact does not owe you, they are generally inclined to help
you, presuming it does not greatly inconvenience them or put them at
great risk. This contact could be a weapons dealer, a high-ranking
government official, a major hypercorp exec, a scientist at the top
of their field, a media icon, a deep-cover mole, a police lieutenant,
or even a field agent from a rival group. Apply a +10 modifier on
Networking and Social Skill Tests with this specific NPC.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Untarnished Reputation</name>
<cost>Cost: 15 CP</cost>
<description>Through fame, a lifetime of achievement, or some lucky
quirk, the character's reputation in one particular social
network is very difficult to assail. Choose one reputation network.
Any test to attack the character's reputation in that network
suffers a -30 modifier, and any rep losses in that network are
automatically halved. This does not apply if the character burns
their own rep.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>You're That Guy!</name>
<cost>Cost: 10 CP</cost>
<description>Sometime in the past, this character got their 5 minutes of
mesh fame in a funny viral meme that swept the solar system. To this
day, strangers who access the character's social profile are
likely to connect them to that meme. Though tedious for the
character, there is a positive side effect, as these strangers
remember the meme fondly and are more likely to help the character
out. Once per game session, the gamemaster may decide that a stranger
with whom the character is interacting and who has access to the
character's online public profile recognizes the character. The
character receives a one-time +20 bonus to any social skill or
Networking Test with that stranger. 
Rule Zero:

In games played via IRC, the frequency (Once per game session) may be
changed to Twice per adventure
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Zoosemiotics</name>
<cost>Cost: 5</cost>
<description>A character with this trait and the Psi trait does not suffer a
modifier when using psi sleights on non-sentient or partly-sentient
animal species.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Addiction (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP (Minor), 10 CP (Moderate), or 20 CP (Major)</bonus>
<description>Addiction comes
in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the
biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug, stimulus
(XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's
physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work
together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game.
Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or
major:

Minor:

A minor addiction is largely kept under control+it does not
ruin the character's life, though it may create some
difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have
a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a
week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If
they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier
on all actions until they get their fix.

Moderate:

A moderate addiction is in full swing. The character obviously has a
problem, and must satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they
fail to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive behavior,
physical sickness, or other side effects until they indulge their
craving. Apply a -20 modifier to all of the character's
actions until they get their fix.
Additionally, a character with
this level of addiction suffers a penalty of -5 DUR (physical
addiction) or -10 to Willpower Stress Tests (mental
addiction).

Major:

A character with a major addiction is on the rapid road to ruin. They
face cravings every 6 hours, and suffer a penalty of -10 DUR
(physical addiction) or -20 to Willpower Stress Tests (mental
addiction). If they fail to get their regular dosage, they suffer a
-30 modifier on all actions until they do. If their life hasn't
already been ruined by their obsession, it soon will be.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Aged (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph is physically aged, and has not been rejuvenated.
Old morphs are increasingly uncommon, though some people adopt them
hoping to gain an air of seniority and respectability. Reduce the
character's aptitude maximums by 5, and apply a -10
modifier on all physical actions. This trait may only be applied to
flat and splicer morphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Aggressive GRM</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is generally only found on uplift biomorphs, but
might be included on any unusual high-end or custom biomorphs. A much
more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in
rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs, the
genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many
sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it
difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify
the morph. Unless "unlocked" by the designer through
further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any
biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the
extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph's DNA, it is
much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and
has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years. At the
gamemaster's discretion, Medicine
Tests to modify or even heal this morph may suffer modifiers ranging
from -10 to -30.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Anomalous Mind</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 20 CP</bonus>
<description>Found almost exclusively in AGIs, uplifts, and the subjects
of highly experimental pyschosurgical procedures, your mental
patterns are dramatically outside the norm of transhumanity. The
uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup,
and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform
psychosurgery on the character suffer a -10 penalty and
automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and
regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. Also, backing up
and resleeving are not automatic and require active management of the
process. Any technician operating the ego bridge during such
procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery
Test or the backup/sleeving attempt will fail.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Bad Luck</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 30 CP</bonus>
<description>Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence, things seem to
go wrong around the character. The gamemaster is given a pool of
Moxie points equal to the character's Moxie stat, which also
refreshes at the same rate as the character's Moxie. Only the
gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use
it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this
bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a
roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the
character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the
character's friends and allies, when they are doing something
with or related to the character, though this should be used
sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the
character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing
this trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Blacklisted</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 or 20 CP</bonus>
<description>The character has managed to get themselves blacklisted
in certain circles, whether they actually did something to deserve it
or not. In game terms, the character is barred from having a Rep
score higher than 0 in one particular reputation network. People
within that network will refuse to help the character out of fear of
reprisals and ruining their own reputation. The bonus for this trait
is 20 CP if chosen for the rep network pertaining to the character's
own starting faction, and 5 CP if chosen for any other.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Beta</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 20 CP</bonus>
<description>This character is a beta fork of their original self, which
for some reason is no longer alive (most likely lost during the
Fall). They were created some time ago, so they have grown and
overcome most of their original aptitude deficiencies. This character
may not have a Moxie higher than 1 and no Active skills higher than
60, nor may they possess the Psi trait. They also have only a limited
set of their original self's memories+much of their
previous life is simply lost to them. They automatically receive the
Edited Memories trait, without gaining the bonus CP. Beta forks are,
of course, illegal in many jurisdictions, and some consider them less
than human (the gamemaster may apply a Social Stigma: Beta trait in
appropriate circumstances; again no bonus CP are gained).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Black Mark</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP</bonus>
<description>At some point in
the character's past, they managed to do something that earned
a black mark on their reputation. For some reason, no matter what
they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt
their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction.
Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking
Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows
who the character is, they suffer a -10 modifier per level.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Botched Merge</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 15 CP</bonus>
<description>In the past, the character suffered a serious complication
during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to
their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and
own identity. For some reason+perhaps due to irreproducible
memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral
conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance+the
decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress
situations can cause periods of dissociation, amnesia, and body
alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must
succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state
where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of
the events around them, and/or forget certain information, memories,
or skills. In this state they suffer a -10 penalty on all
tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the
duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Botched Uplift (Uplifts Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 30 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to uplifts. Although possessed
of a rough self-awareness and the trappings of sapience, your mental
development is flawed. Despite the best efforts of your creators and
teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limitations and
serious social awkwardness. Even psychosurgery is unlikely to fix
you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have
difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and
are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and
coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you
likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your difficulties
are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with
you.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Combat Paralysis</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 20 CP</bonus>
<description>The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing in combat
or stressful situations, like a deer caught in headlights. Anytime
violence breaks out around the character, or they are surprised, the
character must make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in
any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and simply
stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to the situation.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Curbed Intelligence (AGIs Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Fearful of AGIs that might develop into seed AIs like the
TITANs, some developers have programmed extra safeguards and
precautions into AGI mindstates to limit their intelligence. The
aptitude maximum for COG for this AGI character is 15.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Data Footprint</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character is particularly sloppy about keeping a lid on
their daily living, online, and social networking interactions,
leaving a larger data footprint than usual in the public eye. Apply a
+10 modifier to any Research Tests to gather information on the
character or track them online (see Scanning, Tracking, and
Monitoring) and any Networking Tests to ascertain the character's
networking interactions (see Keeping It Quiet).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Debt</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)</bonus>
<description>The character is
in debt to a loan shark or powerful organization that demands regular
payments. The debt may be the result of a legitimate loan or the
character may be a victim of extortion. Either way, the character is
expected to pay, with an interest rate that is far above standard
(and possibly illegal), and the creditor organization will not take
no for an answer. The approximate level of debt is equal to the
following amount:

* Level 1: 20,000 credits (plus 1d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest)

* Level 2: 40,000 credits (plus 2d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest)

* Level 3: 60,000 credits (plus 3d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest)
Each
week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to
the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor
organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms.
Hypercorp creditors may lower the character's rep by publicly
declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego
hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt
collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way
or the other. If the character completely reneges on this debt, they
gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits.
Characters may be
given the option of working off their weekly interest payment+or
even their entire debt+by performing a job or other favor for
the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk
mission for which the organization does not want to use its own
personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested
abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime
syndicate. The higher the debt is, the more dangerous or difficult
the mission will be.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Deferred Indenture</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP (Level 1), 15 CP (Level 2), or 20 CP (Level 3)</bonus>
<description>Due to a prior
contract or sentence, this character has a pending indenture that has
yet to be redeemed. The character is legally obligated to perform
whatever work is asked of them to repay their debt. At Level 1, the
value of the indenture is equivalent to 5,000 credits or a Level 4
favor. At Level 2, it is worth 20,000 credits or a Level 5 favor. At
Level 3, the indenture is worth 40,000 credits or two Level 5 favors.
If the indenture is not honored when called in, the character will be
subject to the legal consequences, up to and including pursuit by law
enforcement and additional criminal penalties from the originating
jurisdiction. Gamemasters and players should outline the
circumstances that led to the establishment of the indenture.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Dependent</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>This character has a dependent+a child, a disabled
family member, or even a much-loved but needy smart animal pet.
Though the character can leave their ward's care in the hands
of a fork or others, they must occasionally attend to the dependent's
needs and may sometimes be forced to bring the dependent with them.
The player and gamemaster should work out the specifics of the
dependent NPC together; this NPC should have no skills or abilities
of value to the player character. The dependent should be a potential
vulnerability for the character that enemies or rivals could exploit.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Divergent Personality</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Something about this character makes their forks diverge
from their core personality more quickly than usual. When attempting
a merge, treat the fork's time apart as if it were one step
lower on the Merging
table. For example, a fork that is absent under an hour is treated as
if it were away for 1-4 hours.
Characters with this trait
may not take the multitasking implant; the continual forking and
merging is too stressful on their mind.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Domineering (Uplifts Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to uplifts and is most common
among neo-hominids. The character retains pre-sapient neurological
urges to gain social status via dominance. The character must make a
WIL x 2 Test to use th Persuasion
skill in any situation where they can safely deploy the Intimidation
skill instead.
Additionally, they must make a WIL x 3 Test to
avoid responding to acts of intimidation with threat displays or
violence, though such violence need not be lethal (note that they
will still back down if someone successfully uses the Intimidation
skill on them). Since the evolutionary purpose of dominance
structures is to minimize conflict, domineering uplifts prefer to
surround themselves with submissives and will avoid entering
situations where they know their dominance might be challenged.
Such
domineering characters often suffer poor reputations in modern
transhuman reputation networks. They may not start with a rep score
higher than 40 in any rep network other than Guanxi.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Drug Fiend (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character or morph has a weak resistance to addiction.
Addiction Tests (including attempts to resist addiction cravings) are
made with a -20 modifier.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Edited Memories</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>At some point in the character's past, the character
had certain memories strategically removed or otherwise lost to them.
This may have been done to intentionally forget an unpleasant or
shameful experience or to make a break with the past. The memory may
also have been lost by an unexpected death (with no recent backup),
or it may have been erased against the character's will.
Whatever the case, the memory should bear some importance, and there
should exist either evidence of what happened or NPCs who know the
full story. This is a tool the gamemaster can use to haunt the
character at some future point with ghosts from their past.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Emotive Blindness (AGIs and Uplifts Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to AGIs and uplifts. This
character has difficulty reading the finer points of social cues,
body language, expressions, emoting, and so forth for any transhuman
outside of its own species. Apply a -10 modifier to Kinesics
Tests used against anyone not of the same species as the character.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Enemy</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>At some point in their past, the character made an enemy for
life who continues to haunt them. The gamemaster and player should
work out the details on this enmity, and the gamemaster should use
the enemy as an occasional threat, surprise, and hindrance.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Errant Fork</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Whether through conscious action or a freak occurrence, you
are not the only you out there. An alpha fork of yourself exists and
has decided to pursue its own path. Though this fork is not
necessarily an enemy, it does have its own agenda and interests that
sometimes run counter to your own. There may be legal issues
involved, such as competing claims over who is the original alpha and
therefore has rights to any property (or in some jurisdictions, the
right to exist). There may be social awkwardness, as the division
between you and your alpha forced you to compete over your friends,
family, or even lovers. Though the alpha fork began with the same
aptitudes, skills, traits, rep, and so on as yourself, it has
diverged and begun to develop as a separate character, controlled by
the gamemaster. Other complications in the relationship between these
alphas should exist, enough that the other alpha should serve as an
occasional hindrance or surprise. The alphas may, for example, have a
strong rivalry going over their shared field of expertise or may
simply feel a need to prove themselves better than the other.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Fast Metabolism (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph's metabolism runs hot, requiring the
character to eat two to three times as much food as a normal
character with similar body mass. Food tends to be plentiful and
cheap in most transhuman settlements, but this trait can pose a
problem in remote areas or when visiting settlements with limited
resources. The character must plan ahead and pack enough food on
expeditions. If the character is eating off their rep, they must
expend two trivial favors each day for the additional food they
require. If the character is unable to obtain enough food, they lose
SOM at the rate of one point per day until they resume their usual
caloric intake. This trait is only available for biomorphs (including
uplifts and pods).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Faulty Education</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Not everyone receives the same quality of education and many
are taught incorrect things. Some children, for example, are raised
with an ideologically driven system that prizes obedience over truth
and accuracy+something still common in certain Jovian, brinker,
and religious communities. Others, like many infugees, isolates, and
zeroed indentures, only have access to substandard or obsolete
reference material. No matter the cause, the character thinks they
know far more than they really do. Once per session, the gamemaster
may intentionally mislead the character when giving them the results
of a Knowledge Skill Test or otherwise detailing some aspect of the
setting or a social interaction, depending on the character's
background. This misinformation represents the character's
faulty understanding of the topic at hand and should be roleplayed
appropriately, even if the player knows that their character is
mistaken.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Feeble</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 20 CP</bonus>
<description>The character is particularly weak with one aptitude. That
aptitude must be purchased at a rating lower than 5, and may never be
upgraded during character advancement. The aptitude maximum is 10, no
matter what morph the character is wearing.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Frail (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</bonus>
<description>This morph is not as resilient as
others of its type. Its Durability is reduced by 5 per level. This
also reduces Wound Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Frail Sanity</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 20)</bonus>
<description>This ego's mind is not
as resilient as others. Its Lucidity is reduced by 5 per level. This
also reduces Trauma Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Genetic Defect (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP or 20 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph is not genefixed, and in fact suffers
from a genetic disorder or other impairing mutation. The player and
gamemaster should agree on a defect appropriate to their game. Some
possibilities include: heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis,
sickle-cell disease, hypertension, hemophilia, or color blindness. A
genetic disorder that creates minor complications and/or occasional
health problems would be worth 10 CP, a defect that significantly
impairs the character's regular functioning or that inflicts
chronic health problems is worth 20 CP. The gamemaster must determine
the exact effects of the disorder on gameplay, as appropriate.
This
trait is only available for flats.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Hoarder</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>With the limitations on living space and need for resource
management in all but the wealthiest habs, most transhumans are used
to living with a minimal number of personal possessions. The
flexibility and multi-purpose nature of most objects and availability
of information, entertainment, and communication over digital or VR
services all allow this to work well, but hoarders have a
psychological compulsion to keep things that they don't need
and serve no purpose. Particularly common among corvid uplifts and
some Fall survivors that lost everything, characters with this trait
have a hard time giving away or disposing of things. Unless their
behavior is somehow managed, they will accumulate overwhelming
collections of junk. Each day, the character must make a WIL x 3 Test
to keep their compulsion under control. If they fail, they will keep
any objects they would normally throw away or recycle (food
packaging, drink bulbs, broken or useless objects like dead ectos,
ammunition clips, and the like) and must acquire one new item that
day; all of those items will be added to their hoard. Hoarders can
force themselves to ignore this compulsion for a day by taking one
point of stress damage. If they ever attempt to clean out their hoard
voluntarily, or if the hoard is significantly reduced (by catastrophe
or by hab maintenance workers forcibly removing it), the character
takes (1d10 / 2) + 2 SV.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Identity Crisis</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character's ego has trouble adapting itself to the
changed look of a new morph+they are stuck with the mental
image of their original body, and simply do not grow accustomed to
their new face(s). As a result, the character has difficulty
identifying themselves in the mirror, photos, surveillance feeds,
etc. They frequently forget the look and shape of their current
morph, acting inappropriately, describing themselves by their
original body, forgetting to duck when walking through doorways, etc.
This is primarily a roleplaying trait, but the gamemaster may apply
appropriate modifiers (usually -10) to tests affected by this
inability to adapt.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Identifiable Quirk</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Transhumans may be able to switch bodies and travel the
entire solar system to start a new life, but some things can't
be left behind. The character has a unique behavioral quirk that
makes identification easy, no matter the morph in which they are
sleeved. Attempts to identify this character through Kinesics
or similar skills gain a +10 bonus. This quirk could be a nervous
twitch of the lips, distinct accent, noticeable laugh, or unusual
gait. The character suffers a -30 modifier to all Impersonation
Tests against targets aware of the character's quirk.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Illiterate</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character knows how to speak, but has difficulty reading
or writing. Due to the entoptic-saturated and icon-driven nature of
transhuman society, they are able to get by quite comfortably with
this handicap. Reduce the character's Language skills by half
(round down) whenever reading or writing.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Immortality Blues</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character has lived so long+over 100 years+
they're bored with life and now have difficulty motivating
themselves. They were old when longevity treatments first became
available, survived the Fall, and continue to soldier onward+though
they find it increasingly harder to care, take interest in things
around them, or fear final death. The character only receives half
the Moxie and Rez Points award for completing motivational goals.
This trait may not be purchased by characters with the infolife,
uplift, or Lost backgrounds.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Impaired Balance</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), or 30 CP (Level 3)</bonus>
<description>This trait is
only available to neo-pigs. This uplift's brain has not been
fully adapted to the neo-pig's bipedal stance and still suffers
occasional difficulties with balance. The character suffers a -10
modifier per level to any Climbing, Freerunning, or similar test
involving balance or upright movement.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Impaired Hearing (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to octomorphs. This morph lacks
the transgenic hearing modifications of modern octomorph designs. The
morph can only hear low sounds in the 400-1,000 Hertz range (as
opposed to the 20-20,000 Hertz range enjoyed by most
trans-humans) and hears poorly when not underwater.
Apply a -30
modifier to any hearing-based Perception Tests. At the gamemaster's
discretion, certain medium and high-frequency sounds may be inaudible
as they are outside the morph's range.
This lack of hearing
may be compensated for with audio implants or microphones and mesh
inserts.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Impaired Linguistics</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1) or 20 CP (Level 2)</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to
uplifts. This uplift's particular brain structure has
difficulty processing language. At Level 1, the uplift loses some of
their ability to speak, read, and comprehend things spoken by others
when they suffer from stress. Each time the uplift suffers a trauma,
they must make a Language Test at -10 to speak (both verbal and
via mesh inserts) or comprehend (reading or listening) anything above
the most basic words and information. This test only needs to be made
once for each language, but for each additional trauma suffered, the
test must be made again, with an additional cumulative -10
modifier. If the uplift loses their language abilities, they will
recover them when that particular trauma is healed. In the meantime,
they can only convey and understand basic, one-word, one-syllable
concepts, such as "eat" or "run."
At Level
2, the uplift's language centers are permanently hobbled. Their
free natural Language skill at character creation is 40 + INT, and no
Language skill may be raised above 60. Additionally, they must make
make a Language Test to convey or comprehend particularly complex
information or sentences at a -10 modifier. At the gamemaster's
discretion, this may also impair other skill tests, particularly
Knowledge skills when dealing with detailed data or specialist
terminology. Level 2 does not incorporate Level 1 effects.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Impaired Proprioception (Morph Trait) (Octomorphs and Flying Squid only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to octomorphs and flying squid
morphs. Baseline cephalopods lack a sense of proprioception in their
arms and tentacles, meaning they only know where their limbs are by
looking at them. Though a standard proprioceptive sense was added to
most octomorph and flying squid models, a number of germlines lack
the proper neural structure. A morph with this trait suffers a -10
modifier on Fray
Tests to avoid attacks or get out of the way and gains no benefits
from the Ambidextrous trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Implant Rejection (Morph Trait</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 (Level 1) or 15 (Level 2) CP</bonus>
<description>This morph does not accept implants
well. At Level 1, any implants acquired are more expensive as they
required specialized anti-rejection treatments. Increase the Cost
category of the implant by one. At Level 2, the morph cannot accept
implants of any kind.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Incompetent</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character is completely incapable of performing a
particular chosen active skill, no matter any training they may
receive. They may not buy this skill during character creation or
later advancement, and the modifier for defaulting to the linked
aptitude of this particular skill is -10. This may not be used
for exotic weapon skills, and should be used for a skill that could
be of use to the character.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Intense Relationship</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Many characters retain close relationships with family,
friends, and lovers. Sometimes, however, the interpersonal connection
in these relationships becomes so intense as to be a detriment. The
character is emotionally dependent on their relationship with a
particular NPC to the point that being separated from the NPC is
taxing. Each week the character goes without meaningful communication
with the NPC, they suffer 1 point of stress. If cut off for more than
two weeks, they also suffer a -10 modifier to all Task Actions
until they are able to reconnect, as they are too distracted to
focus. The character also suffers double the stress from witnessing
the NPC being hurt or killed.
Basic operational security dictates
that the character cannot tell the NPC anything about firewall nor
can they communicate with the NPC during a firewall mission.
Characters breaking these rules put the lives of their friends and
family at risk. Gamemasters should have enemies of firewall use
friends and family against characters who break these rules.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Lacks Manipulators (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This morph lacks hands or other limbs with a fine
manipulation capability. It is a common trait with quadrupeds (as
well as certain smart animals). A morph with this trait may not be
able to manipulate objects at all or may only be able to do so with a
very limited capacity. Some morphs can hold small-sized or smaller
tools, weapons, and other objects between their paws or in their
mouths, for example, but unless these items have been specifically
designed to operate with this morphology, the character will suffer a
-30 modifier to use or may not be able to use them at all
(gamemaster discretion). Objects that don't require physical
manipulation, such as tools controlled by wireless commands, may be
used normally. Some morphs with this trait+particularly
quadrupeds+may be unable to hold an object between their paws
and move at the same time or may require a SOM x 3 Test to retain
their balance while standing upright to hold something.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Lemon (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available for synthetic morphs. This
particular morph has some unfixable flaws. Once per game session
(preferably at a time that will maximize drama or hilarity), the
gamemaster can call for the character to make a MOX x 10 Test (using
their current Moxie score). If the character fails, the morph
immediately suffers 1 wound resulting from some mechanical failure,
electrical glitch, or other breakdown. This wound may be repaired as
normal.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Lost Fork</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>A fork of the character has gone missing without a trace. The
fork was legal and in compliance with all relevant laws and
standards+then it vanished. The version that disappeared was an
alpha fork, a complete recent copy of the character's ego that
possesses sensitive knowledge about all aspects of the character's
life. Players and gamemasters should discuss this trait before using
it in their game and address the following questions: When did the
disappearance occur? Why was the fork created? What was the fork
doing just before the disappearance? What leads, if any, does the
player possess at the start of the game? This trait is often taken in
combination with the Edited Memories, Enemy, and/or On the Run
traits.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Low-Gravity Adaptation (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph is adapted to live in low gravity (0.15 g or less)
and struggles in higher-gravity environments. Treat the character as
suffering the effects of high gravity for every full 0.2 g over 0.15.
For example, while the character would operate fine on Luna
or Titan,
on Mars
or Mercury
(both 0.38 g) the character would be treated as if suffering the
effects of 1 wound. On Venus
(0.9 g), the character would be treated as if suffering the effects
of 3 wounds. For each of these high gravity increments, also reduce
the character's Walking Rate by 1 and their Running Rate by 4.
While even low-gravity-adapted bodies can sustain the stress of high
gravity (over 1 g) for temporary periods, the gamemaster may rule
that long-term exposure to higher gravity may result in the
accumulation of actual wounds, not just wound effects. This trait may
not be applied to morphs with the High-G Adaptation trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Low Pain Tolerance (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 20 CP</bonus>
<description>Pain is the character's enemy. The character has a
very low threshold for pain tolerance and is more severely impaired
when suffering. Increase the modifier for each wound take by an
additional -10 (so the character suffers -20 with one
wound, -40 with another, and -60 with a third).
Additionally, the character suffers a -30 modifier on any test
involving pain resistance. This morph version of this trait is only
available for biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Memory Artifact (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>This particular morph has an anomalous neural structure. As a
result, sometimes not all aspects of an ego are properly erased after
it has been uploaded and the mind is customarily wiped. This morph
has memories from a previous ego that continue to resurface. Once per
week, the ego sleeved in the morph must make a MOX x 10 Test. If it
fails, certain memories will manifest in the current occupant's
mind. This memories are likely to be from emotionally charged or
otherwise memorable events in a previous ego's life. The first
time the latent memories activate, the ego suffers (1d10 / 2)
SV. Additional incidents of memory recall may or may not inflict
stress, depending on the memory in question (traumatic ones certainly
will), how drastically the memories conflict with the character's
personality, and whether or not the character is aware of the source
of these memories. The character naturally integrates these memories
in with their own, making them a long-term or possibly permanent
change that can only be removed with psychotherapy. These memories
may of course be useful for plot purposes, as they may include
sensitive data, secrets hidden from the public, or information the
previous ego does not want spread. Gamemasters should not allow this
trait for morphs that will be sleeved for less than a week unless
they increase the test frequency from weekly to daily.

</trait>
<trait>
<name>Mild Allergy (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph is allergic to a specific chosen allergen (dust,
dander, plant pollen, certain chemicals) and suffers mild discomfort
when exposed to it (eye irritation, sneezing, difficult breathing).
Apply a -10 modifier to all tests while the character remains
exposed. This trait is only available for biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Modified Behavior</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 (Level 1), 10 (Level 2), or 20 (Level 3) CP</bonus>
<description>The character has
been conditioned via time-accelerated behavioral control
psychosurgery. This is common among ex-felons, who have been
conditioned to respond to a specific idea or activity with vehement
horror and disgust, but may have occurred for some other reason or
even been self-inflicted. At Level 1, the chosen behavior is either
limited or boosted, at Level 2 it is either blocked or encouraged,
and at Level 3 it is expunged or enforced. This trait should only be
allowed for behaviors that are either limited or, if encouraged,
impact the character in a negative way.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Morphing Disorder</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP</bonus>
<description>Adapting to new
morphs is particularly challenging for this character. The character
suffers a -10 modifier per level on Integration
Tests and Alienation Tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Neural Damage</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character has suffered some type of neurological damage
that simply cannot be cured. The affliction is now part of the
character's ego and remains with them even when remorphing.
This damage may have been inherited, it may have resulted from a
poorly designed morph or implant, or it may have been inflicted by
one of the TITAN nanovirii that targeted neural systems during the
Fall. The gamemaster and player should agree on a specific disorder
appropriate to their game. Some possibilities are:

* Partial aphasia (difficulty communicating or using words)

* Color blindness

* Amusica (inability to make or understand music)

* Synaesthesia

* Logorrhoea (excessive use of words)

* Loss of face recognition

* Loss of depth perception (double range modifiers)

* Repetitive behavior

* Mood swings

* The inability to shift attention quickly
(The gamemaster may decide to inflict modifiers resulting from this
affliction as appropriate.)
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Neurochemical Imbalance (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>Something about this morph's neurochemistry (or its
neurochemical simulators, in the case of pods and synthmorphs) is
unbalanced. Egos that sleeve into this morph struggle with a strong,
almost overwhelming emotion: sadness, despair, frustration,
loneliness, manic intensity, anxiety, euphoria, and so on. The
strength of this emotion may ebb and wane, but it is omnipresent
enough to have a consistent impact on the character's mood and
personality. This imposed emotion does not affect the character's
abilities, but it should be taken into effect for roleplaying
purposes. The emotion may be quelled with endocrine control implants
(but not emotional dampers) or temporarily overcome via a
Psychosurgery
Test (for biomorphs) or Hardware:
Robotics Test (for synthmorphs). Specific drugs may also reduce the
effect, based on the particular aptitude affected. Despite these
efforts, the emotion will return in 1d10 days.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>No Cortical Stack (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph lacks the cortical stack that is common to morphs
of its type. This means the character cannot be resleeved from the
cortical stack if the character dies, they can only be resleeved from
a standard backup. This trait is not available for flats.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Not a Team Player</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This character is socially awkward, self-centered, or has
such low self esteem that they simply do not work well others. The
character does not benefit from teamwork bonuses when others try to
aid them, and if they attempt to aid someone else (whether
voluntarily or forced), they will apply a -10 modifier to the
test rather than aiding with a +10.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Oblivious</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character is particularly oblivious to events around
them or anything other than what their attention is focused on. They
suffer a -10 modifier to Surprise Tests and their modifier for
being Distracted is -30 rather than the usual -20 (see
Basic
Perception).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>On The Run</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character is wanted by the authorities of a particular
habitat/station or faction, who continue to actively search for the
character. They either committed a crime or somehow displeased
someone in power. The character deals with that faction in question
at their own risk, and may occasionally be forced to deal with bounty
hunters.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Overwhelmed by Emotions (AGIs Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to AGIs. The character has a
particularly difficult time adjusting to hormonal urges and emotions
when sleeved in biomorphs. The character suffers a -10 modifier
when resisting any form of emotional manipulation, including
Intimidation
and most Persuasion
Tests. Additionally the character suffers a -10 modifier to
Stress Tests involving emotions, fear, or pain. At the gamemaster's
discretion, certain intense emotions or rushes may temporarily
overwhelm the character; if they fail a WIL x 3 Test, they are
disoriented and must spend a Complex Action to regain their wits.
Gamemasters should not allow this trait for characters that are
unlikely to ever sleeve into biomorphs+or should at least
occasionally put them in situations that force them into one.
Endocrine control does not completely mitigate these effects, though
some of the modifiers may cancel out.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Personality Artifact (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Minor but occasionally intrusive echoes of previous egos
that have inhabited the morph still remain as mental artifacts. Once
per week, the ego sleeved in the morph must make a MOX x 10 Test. If
it fails, certain character traits manifest in the current occupant's
mind, causing personality or behavior modification. Roll on the
Personality Artifact table and apply the result; the effect lasts for
(1d10 / 2) days. With a successful INT x 3 Test, the character
will recognize the manifesting behavior as foreign and suffer (1d10 /
2) SV. Additional incidents may or may not inflict stress, depending
on the change in question, how drastically the changes conflict with
the character's personality, and whether or not the character
is aware of the source of these memories. These personality changes
are not permanent and will not transfer with the character's
ego when they resleeve. Gamemasters should not allow this trait for
morphs that will be sleeved for less than a week, unless they
increase the test frequency from weekly to daily.

</trait>
<trait>
<name>Phobia Disorder</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Phobias are a minor type of mental anxiety disorder based on
an irrational fear of a particular situation or thing. Phobic
characters will go to great lengths to avoid their particular
fear+they must make a WIL x 3 Test to even stay within
proximity, otherwise they will flee the area. If forced into close
proximity with their fear, they will suffer 1 SV per hour and take a
-10 modifier to all of their actions. If they are trapped in
close proximity to the source of their fear, they will suffer (1d10 /
2) SV per hour and take a -30 modifier to all actions. Luckily,
phobias are easier to treat than other disorders. The base timeframe
for psychotherapy treatment of a phobia is 20 hours.
Phobia
disorders may be inflicted on characters that suffer too many traumas
in place of other mental disorders. Gamemasters should keep in mind,
however, that phobias are easier to treat; though the possibility of
taking more mental stress from the phobia may offset this. At the
gamemaster's discretion, temporary phobias can be used as
derangements inflicted with mental trauma. In these situations, the
phobia should be linked to the particular source of trauma. For
example, a character who suffers a trauma from remembering their
death after vacuum exposure might pick up a derangement phobia of
vacuum environments.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Planned Obsolescence</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP
(Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time,
the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph
on GSP "upgrades." If they fail to do so, the morph's
SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These
penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but
getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers
no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in
hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic
suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation,
minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express
later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and
tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added
features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead
to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops
accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character
regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only
available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Poorly Socialized</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is most common among AGIs and uplifts, but can be
taken by anyone. The character's early life experience left
them poorly prepared for interacting with the general public, and
they come off as boorish, distant, or strange until they get to know
someone well. Due to the difficult nature of the character's
behavior, they suffer a -10 modifier on all Social Skill Tests
whenever the character is interacting with another character for the
first time only.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Proprietary Tech (Morph Trait) (Synthmorphs Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to synthmorphs. This morph was
built to non-standard specifications, so that normal tools and
software do not properly work on this morph. This is a conscious
design decision by the manufacturer of the morph and is often used as
a means of control. By limiting access to repair and modifications,
the morph is dependent on the manufacturer. Highly skilled
technicians can work around these barriers, but it impedes work.
Standard repair and diagnostic tools like repair spray and fixer
nanoswarms do not work on this morph, except for
manufacturer-approved brands. Characters with Hardware: Robotics can
repair or modify the morph but at a -20 modifier.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Psi Vulnerability (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Something about the character's mind makes them
particularly vulnerable to psi attack. They suffer a -10
modifier when resisting such attacks. The morph version of this trait
may only be taken by biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Real World Naivete</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Due to their background, the character has very limited
personal experience with the real (physical) world+or they have
spent so much time in simulspace that their functioning in real life
is impaired. They lack an understanding of many physical properties,
social cues, and other factors that people with standard human
upbringings take for granted. This lack of common sense may lead the
character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret
someone's body language.
Once per game session, the
gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a
description about some thing or some social interaction. This
falsehood represents the character's misunderstanding of the
situation, and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player
realizes the character's mistake.
This trait should only be
available to characters with the infolife or re-instantiated
backgrounds,
though the gamemaster may allow it for characters who have extensive
virtual reality/XP use in their personal histories.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Reduced Size (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait reduces the size of an existing morph model from
either large to medium or medium to small (morphs may only be reduced
once). Morphs shrunk to a medium size lose the effects of the Large
Size trait and 10 points of Durability. Morphs reduced to a small
size gain the effects of the Small Size trait and lose 5 points of
Durability. Durability reductions also effect Wound Threshold and
Death Rating per normal. Reducing a morph may affect other changes at
the gamemaster's discretion.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Severe Allergy (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 (uncommon) or 20 (common) CP</bonus>
<description>The morph's biochemistry
suffers a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into
contact (touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen. The
allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain foods,
latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect stings). The player and
gamemaster should agree on an allergen that fits the game. If exposed
to the allergen, the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to
breathing (-30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR
Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory failure in
2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied).
This trait is only
available to biomorphs.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Shut-In</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 15 CP</bonus>
<description>This character is a social hermit or went through a period
of self-imposed isolation, limiting the amount of interactions they
have via online social networks. Because the character is out of
touch, their ability to network with others is impaired. Apply a -10
modifier to Networking Tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Slow Learner</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>New skills are not easy for this character to pick up. The
character takes twice as long as normal to improve skills or learn
new ones.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Social Stigma (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>An unfortunate aspect of the character's background
means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations.
They may be sleeved in a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor
of the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in a post-Fall
society plagued by fear of artificial intelligence. In social
situations where the character's nature is known to someone who
view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a
-10 to -30 modifier (gamemaster's discretion) to
social skill tests.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Socially Graceless</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Something about the character makes them a walking social
disaster. While the character can be charming and confident, they
forget basic social etiquette, overlook customs and rules, miss
social cues, and overstep their bounds. Once per game session, the
gamemaster can treat one social interaction (preferably where a
Social Skill Test by the character was involved) as a critical
failure. Usually this results in someone being offended, becoming
hostile, or refusing to work with the character. Protocol
may not be used to wipe away this social gaffe, nor may Moxie negate
it.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Solitary (Neo-Octopi Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to neo-octopi uplifts. Like its
pre-sapient kin, this uplift prefers solitude and has not been fully
socialized. As a result, they can only tolerate 2 hours of direct
interaction (physical or virtual) with others before they need a
break and some alone time (at least 2 hours). If forced into a
situation where they must interact or exist in close proximity to
others for more than 2 hours, they suffer a cumulative -10
modifier to all Social Skill Tests per 2-hour period, up to a maximum
of -30. After 6 hours, they must a WIL x 3 Test to keep their
composure and not react towards those around them with aggression,
hostility, or even violence. This trait is usually taken in
conjunction with the Hardening (Isolation) trait.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Stalker</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>A voyeur obsessively stalks this character's actions
online. The gamemaster and player should work out details of the
stalker together, and the gamemaster should use the stalker as a plot
element to create occasional nuisances and challenges. The stalker
could, for example, be a fan who over-appreciates the character's
work and pesters them or a unknown entity that follows the
character's actions religiously and posts the details to an
online log.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Stolen Identity</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>Someone stole this character's identity and took
advantage of their name, reputation, background+the works.
Though this happened in the past, the situation was never fully
resolved and the character is plagued with collateral difficulties
from the theft. The gamemaster and player should work out details of
the incident together, and the gamemaster should use this to
occasionally hinder the character or create complications. For
example, the character may have to deal with criminal charges against
them in one habitat, angry thugs looking for payback on another, and
so on.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Submissive (Uplifts Only)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 5 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to uplifts. This character
retains a tendency to submit to displays of dominance, inherited from
their pre-sapient forebears. The character suffers a -20
modifier in Opposed Tests against Intimidation from NPCs with
perceived social status.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Subverted Mind</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 30 CP</bonus>
<description>Similar to the Modified Behavior trait, the character has
been conditioned by behavioral control psychosurgery+in this
case, an expunged or enforced behavior. The character is unaware of
this mind editing, however, as the procedure also included an
awareness block. This means the character could be a secret spy,
courier, or saboteur, possibly even regularly engaging in behavior of
which they are completely unaware. Alternatively, they could simply
be an enemy's secret ace in the hole, a trump card to exploit
when the time is right. Keep in mind that, due to the awareness
block, even when the character's hidden programming becomes
apparent to others, they will be cognitively incapable of recognizing
it themselves, which is certain to be an incredibly stressful
experience all around.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Temperature Intolerance (Warm) (Morph Trait)</name>
<description>The
morph is adapted for extreme cold and has difficulty dissipating body
heat in temperatures tolerated by normal transhumans. When exposed to
vacuum or temperatures above 5 C for more than 10 minutes, the
character suffers a -10 modifier to all actions. At 10 C,
increase the modifier to -20. At temperatures above 25 C, the
character may suffer 1d10 DV per hour exposed from overheating, at
the gamemaster's discretion. These effects can be nullifed
by wearing a vacsuit, the application of some sort of cooling system,
or returning to a suitably cold environment.
Bonus: 10 CP

</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Timid</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This character frightens easily. They suffer a -10
modifier when resisting fear or intimidation.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Trusting Heart</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character has a tendency to trust others far too quickly
and is devastated when betrayed. Stress loss from betrayal is doubled
and the character suffers a -10 modifier when using Kinesics
in Opposed Tests against Deception
or Impersonation
skills.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Unattractive (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)</bonus>
<description>In a time when
good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As
unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor,
backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks
range from distaste to horror. The character suffers a -10
modifier on social tests for Level 1, -20 for Level 2, and -30
for Level 3.
Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modifier
does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the
infolife or uplift backgrounds. This modifier may be purchased for
uplift morphs, but at half the bonus, and it is only effective
against characters with that specific uplift background (i.e.,
neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Uncanny Valley (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>There is a point where synthetic human looks become
uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but they remain just different
enough that their looks seem creepy or even repulsive+a
phenomenon called the "uncanny valley." Morphs whose
looks fall into this range suffer a -10 modifier on social
skill tests when dealing with humans. This modifier does not apply to
interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift
backgrounds.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Uncontrollable Urge (Ego or Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The ego or morph has an overwhelming primal drive that is
not properly filtered by the brain, such as the urge for hunting,
hiding food, mating, marking territory, driving off competitors (or,
for the rare synthmorph, cleaning, serving, or shutting down when not
in use), and so on. When presented with triggering stimuli, the
character must pass a WIL x 3 Test to resist acting out the
compulsion immediately. While resisting the compulsion, the character
suffers a -10 to all actions. Uncontrollable drives are poorly
received in most circles. This trait is most common among uplifts.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Unfit (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2)</bonus>
<description>The morph is either not optimized
for health and/or just in bad shape. Reduce the aptitude maximums for
Coordination, Reflexes, and Somatics by 5 (Level 1) or 10 (Level 2).
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>VR Vertigo</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>The character experiences intense vertigo and nausea when
interfacing with any type of virtual reality, XP, or simulspace.
Augmented reality has no effect, but VR inflicts a -30 modifier
to all of the character's actions. Prolonged use of VR
(gamemaster's discretion) may actually incapacitate the
character should they fail a WIL x 2 Test.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Wait, That Was You?</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This character was the unfortunate star of a viral meme that
swept through the solar system's mesh networks+provoking
anger, disgust, or mockery towards them. To this day, strangers who
access the character's social profile are likely to connect
them to that meme, coloring their perception of the character. Once
per game session, the gamemaster may decide that a stranger with whom
the character is interacting and who has access to the character's
online public profile makes the connection. The character suffers a
one-time -20 modifier to any social skill or Networking Test
with that stranger.

<name>Weak Grip (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This trait is only available to neo-avian and neo-pig
morphs. The physiology of this particular morph is flawed in that the
opposable digits on the hands are not fully formed or operational. A
character in this morph loses their damage bonus in melee attacks and
suffers a -10 modifier on subdual tests and any other tests
involving their grip, hand strength, or ability to hold on.

<trait>
<name>Weak Immune System (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP</bonus>
<description>The morph's immune system is
susceptible to diseases, drugs, and toxins. At Level 1, apply a -10
modifier whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects of
a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modifier to -20.
This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<name>Zero-G Nausea</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 10 CP</bonus>
<description>This morph suffers from space sickness and does not fair
well in zero-gravity. The character suffers a -10 modifier in
any microgravity climate. Additionally, whenever the character is
first getting acclimated or anytime they must endure excessive
movement in microgravity, they must make a WIL Test or spend 1 hour
incapacitated by nausea per 10 points of MoF.
</description>

<trait>
<name>Emotive (Morph Trait, Synthmorphs Only)</name>
<description>The
emotive circuits for this morph are exceptional. Kinesics
Tests made against the morph suffer only a -10 modifer,
rather than the usual -30 for synthmorphs. This is useful when
non-vocally emoting to friends, and not so great when trying to hide
your intentions from others.
</description>
</trait>
<trait>
<name>Large Size (Morph Trait)</name>
<description>The
morph is signifcantly larger than a normal transhuman, which
has its advantages and disadvantages. The character counts as a large
target in combat, granting all enemies a +10 bonus on attack rolls
against the character. Their mass works against them; double the
damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The
character gains the reach advantage against standard-size targets
(double this against small targets) and can also wield two-handed
weapons in one hand without penalty. At the gamemaster's
discretion, the character may suffer a -20 modifer when
handling small items, assuming they come equipped with no fne
manipulators. Naturally, they may also have diffculty with
armor, clothing, and other gear manufactured for smaller morphs, as
well as the cramped confnes of many habitats.
This trait
applies to morphs that are inherently large. To apply it to existing
morphs with a smaller baseline, use the Enlarged Size trait.
The
following existing morphs are considered to have the Large Size
trait: fenrir, neo-beluga, neo-orca, q-morph, sundiver.
The
following existing bots and vehicles are also considered large:
dwarf, fux car, fying car, ground car, hyperdense
exoskeleton, Mars buggy, portable plane, rocket buggy, skimmer.

<name>Non-Human Biochemistry (Morph Trait)</name>
<description>Biomorphs
(including pods) with this trait are developed from non-human (but
still mammalian) species or have been genetically modifed
enough that they are substantially different from humans. Though they
are often medically similar to humans, there may be notable
differences, and certain common drugs and medical treatments may not
work on the morph or may have drastically different results. Though
most non-human morphs are developed without allergies, some are
occasionally overlooked. Common augmentations may not be available
for this morph or may need extra time to prepare. Medicine:
Uplift or Medicine: Exotic Biomorph is used to medically treat these
morphs. Apply a -10 modifer to any other Medicine skills
used to heal or augment the morph; gamemasters should also feel free
to increase this modifer to -20 or -30 and/or
adjust the timeframe based on the character's condition and
resources available to the medical staff.
Non-anthropomorphic
morphs with this trait count as exotic and infict -30
modifers to Alienation and Integration Tests. This trait is
only available to morphs created from non-human biochemistries. The
following existing morphs are considered to have the Non-Human
Biochemistry trait: aquanaut, hypergibbon, neanderthal, neo-beluga,
neo-dolphin, neo-hominid (bonobo, chimp, orangutan, and gorilla),
neo-orca, neo-pig, neo-porpoise, neo-whale, selkie, surya.

<name>Non-Mamamalian Biochemistry (Morph Trait)</name>
<description>Biomorphs
(including pods) with this trait are developed from non-mammalian
biologies. The state of medicine for these morphs is often not quite
as advanced as it is for humans, and certain common drugs and medical
treatments may not work on the morph or may have drastically
different results. Though most non-mammalian morphs are developed
without allergies, some are occasionally overlooked. Common
augmentations may not be available for this morph or may need extra
time to prepare. Medicine:
Uplift or Medicine: Exotic Biomorph is used to medically treat these
morphs. Apply a -20 modifer to any other Medicine skills
used to heal or augment the morph; gamemasters should also feel free
to increase this modifer to -30 and/or adjust the
timeframe based on the resources available to the medical
staff.
Morphs with this trait count as exotic and infict
-30 modifers to Alienation and Integration Tests. This
trait is only available to morphs created from non-mammalian
biochemistries. The following existing morphs are considered to have
the Non-Mammalian Biochemistry trait: chickcharnie, hulder, neoavian,
novacrab, octomorph, ripwing, salamander.

<trait>
<name>Small Size (Morph Trait)</name>
<description>The
morph is signifcantly smaller than a normal transhuman,
roughly child-sized. The character counts as a small target in
combat; apply a -10 modifer to attacks against the
character. Standard-size opponents have a reach advantage against the
character and large and very large opponents will have double this
advantage. The character may also, at the gamemaster's
discretion, suffer a -20 modifer when handling
medium-sized gear or two-handed weapons that have not been modifed
for their size. They may also have diffculty with armor, gear,
and so on manufactured for larger morphs. Small morphs have an
aptitude maximum for SOM of 25.
This trait applies to morphs that
are inherently small. To apply it to existing morphs with a larger
baseline, use the Reduced Size trait.
The following existing
morphs are considered to have the Small Size trait: dragonfy,
fexbot modules, hypergibbon, kite, neo-avian, neotenic,
scurrier, spare.
The following existing bots/vehicles are
considered to have the Small Size trait: bughunter, caretaker,
creepy, explorenaut, gnat, manipulator cuff, saucer, spider hand,
thumper.
The following existing smart animals are considered to
have the Small Size trait: aquarium pet, guard dog, police baboon,
rust hound, smart cat/dog/hawk/monkey/racoon/rat/wolf, space roach,
squidling, swarm cat.

<trait>
<name>Unique Look</name>
<description>The morph is engineered to stand out in a society with sophisticated
cloning and fabrication technology. The exact nature of the unique
look varies based on the morph. Some employ proprietary technology
secured by DRM in order to prevent others from copying the exact look
of the morph. Others are secured by reputation alone+the look
of an infamous triad crime boss would never be copied for fear of
retribution. Whatever the reason, no one will mistake this morph for
someone else. Any attempt to impersonate a morph with this trait
suffers a -30 penalty. Characters with this trait tend to cause
extremely positive or negative reactions in social situations.
Characters with this trait may gain a positive modifer of up
to +30 in certain Social Skill Tests or suffer up to a -30
penalty on Social Skill Tests, depending on the circumstance.
In
general, morphs with the Unique Look trait are strongly associated
with a particular element of transhuman society, so characters with
this trait will become de facto representatives of that element of
society and others will treat them accordingly.

<trait>
<name>Very Large Size (Morph Trait)</name>
<description>The morph is huge in size, bigger than many vehicles. It counts as a very
large target in combat, providing opponents with a +20 modifer
to hit. Their mass works against them; triple the damage from falling
or collisions after armor is applied. The morph gains the reach
advantage against large-sized targets; double this bonus against
medium and small targets. It can wield two-handed weapons in one
hand, but suffers a -20 modifer with medium-sized
objects and cannot use small items or smaller, unless they come
equipped with fne manipulators. Very large morphs are too big
to wear standard clothing and armor and do not ft within the
confnes of cramped habitats.
This trait only applies to
morphs that are inherently very large. The following existing morphs
are considered to have the Very Large Size trait: neo-whales and
surya.
The following existing bots and vehicles are considered to
have the Very Large Size trait: cargo hauler, crasher truck, deep sea
submarine, defense platform, fghter, GEV, interceptor, large
jet, lifeboat, maglev train, Martian rover, methane skiff, mobile
base, outsystem hover/skimmer, scorcher, siftrunner, small jet,
SLOTV, Titanian cargo copter, utility helicopter, Venusian hauler.

<name>Very Small Size (Bots/Creatures Only)</name>
<description>The bot or creature is roughly mouse- or insect-sized. It counts as a
very small target in combat; apply a -30 modifer to
attacks against it. Halve the damage from falling or collisions after
armor is applied. Small-size opponents have a reach advantage against
it and larger opponents will have double this advantage. The
bot/critter suffers a -20 modifer when handling
small-sized gear and cannot use any gear that is larger. It cannot
use standard clothing or armor and is too small to ft a
cyberbrain. Very small bots and animals have an aptitude maximum for
SOM of 5. This trait only applies to bots and creatures that are
inherently very small.
The following existing bots and creatures
are considered to have the Very Small Size trait: bees/ wasps, recon
fyer/hopper/snake, sky mote, speck.

<trait>
<name>Whole Body Apoptosis (Morph Trait)</name>
<bonus>Bonus: 0 CP</bonus>
<description>This morph has been genetically programmed to suffer a sudden and lethal
massive cellular failure at some point in the future, usually within
a given 10 year period, though it is possible to target a specifc
date, give or take a few months. This modification is favored by
bioconservatives that wish to live healthy and die quickly and
"naturally." The cellular failure takes about 10 minutes
to complete, giving the character time to stop what they are doing,
send any fnal messages, or commit any other fnal acts.
This trait may only be applied to biomorphs (including
pods).
Apoptosis may not be initiated voluntarily.
