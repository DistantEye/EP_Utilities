Maybe make a morphs list, with notes about what step/location they came from, and which one is active. It DOES look like you can have multiple morphs

Implement an effects list for all the morphs so it simply knows the mechanical effects of each baseline morph 

You know, you could make this even more interesting and use "define command", using all the tools structured so far, and by expanding the idea of $0,$1,$2, etc equals params of calling function to all functions. Basically allow structures that break complex commands into simpler ones. This. In turn, could lead to the generalization of all character attributes to variables, although honestly some structural stuff is good.

Some short TODO items also exist in the code

Need to make statusMessages to UIObject for most commands, currently it'll just silently plow through	
	
Make Table 11,69's effect more validated rather than lazy

Remember that characters store a {speedBonus} variable to track any adjustments to speed

Make Sleights also use XML (possibly the whole internalInfo file)

may need to do something special with if conditionals : right now getVar will try and resolve for both branches, which can break things


Two choices in same effect still breaks things. This is an issue for the sklSpec() command
