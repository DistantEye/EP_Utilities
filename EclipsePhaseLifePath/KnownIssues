1) Nothing stops you from taking the same package over and over
2) No tracking of derived stats like LUC
	1) this should get its own trio of rows for base, bonus, final
3) No handling of morph bonuses (although you are allowed to key in bonuses manually)
	1) There is plans for how to handle this in the TODO
4) No handling when duplicate skills are assigned (should prompt you whether to replace or append)
5) A lot of choices for rep should be random? But are left to choice via rep(?1? ...
6) The events for gaining a smart animal or bot aren't limited at all to anything and instead use gear(?1?)
7) GATECRASHING_EVENT 21–48 cannot be done by code under the current system because it's too broad to anticipate and there's no means for replacing/removing a package
	1) Either leave it this way or eventually recode things so you can do fancy prompts for package replacement and recalculation
